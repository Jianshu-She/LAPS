In the realm of clinical data, transformers have the potential to greatly improve the efficiency and accuracy of data analysis and decision-making.\n\nOne key benefit of using transformers in clinical data is their ability to handle large amounts of data and make predictions based on context. Traditional machine learning models often struggle with handling large amounts of data and maintaining context, leading to reduced accuracy in prediction tasks. In contrast, transformers use self-attention mechanisms to better understand the relationships between different pieces of data, allowing them to make more accurate predictions even with large amounts of data.\n\nAnother benefit of using transformers in clinical data is their ability to handle unstructured and noisy data. Clinical data can often be messy and difficult to interpret, as it may come from a variety of sources such as electronic health records, notes from clinicians, and patient surveys. Transformers are well-suited to handling this type of data, as they can extract useful information and make predictions even in the presence of noise and inconsistencies.\n\nIn addition to their ability to handle large amounts of data and handle unstructured and noisy data, transformers can also improve the efficiency of data analysis in clinical settings. Traditional machine learning models may require extensive feature engineering, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. In contrast, transformers can learn useful features directly from the data, reducing the need for manual feature engineering and enabling faster analysis of clinical data.\n\nOverall, the use of transformers in clinical data has the potential to greatly improve the accuracy and efficiency of data analysis and decision-making. While further research is needed to fully realize the benefits of transformers in this domain, it is clear that they offer a promising approach for handling the complex and diverse nature of clinical data."}

ROXIE (16, insightful, insecure, bald) is a typical teenage girl, except…she has Alopecia. Completely hairless, Roxie wears a wig, leaving most her peers unaware of her condition. Life hasn’t been so easy since she lost her hair. Her father ADAM (50) left the family to move to Montauk, leaving DEBRA (40’s, marketing exec, fitness obsessed, anorexic) an emotional wreck. Fortunately, Roxie’s supported by her bestie LIZZIE (16, lesbian). Roxie crushes on MIKE (17, hot) in her gym class but’s terrified he’ll think she’s a freak. It’s near the end of the school year, summer’s arrived. Roxie’s grandmother, LENORE (77, regal) calls Debra from Florida with unfortunate news; Larry, Debra’s father and Lenore’s husband of fifty years, has passed away. She’ll be flying home with the body tomorrow for a weekend funeral.\n\nLenore arrives and makes funeral arrangements. She loves Roxie dearly, and pulls a softer side of the girl out from beneath her bratty teenage veneer. Roxie’s beautiful when she has her wig off, stunning even. Roxie can’t imagine ever showing the world her baldness. Debra’s devastated to lose her father. Lenore was once a famous soap opera actress, leaving Larry to do most of the parenting when Debra was a child. Adam attends the funeral awkwardly but Lenore’s glad he came. He tells Roxie he’s started seriously dating someone up in Montauk, infuriating Debra. That night, Roxie goes to a beach party with Lenore and gets high with the popular kids including Mike, and Lizzie's secret girlfriend ALLISON (17). Everyone’s flirty and fun but when Mike suggests they all go swimming, Roxie freaks and makes Lizzie take her home. (She can’t get her wig wet)\n\nDebra’s work has suffered since her separation. Her boss chews her out for laziness, tardiness, pushing Debra to work harder to improve herself. Debra tries myriad fitness activities throughout the film, and is almost always working out or planning a new diet. At her gym, she meets JEFF (50’s, fit, kind) and oh do the sparks fly. Jeff works at a local Beach Club and offers to give Roxie a job for the summer. He’d also give the family free access to the club. He really likes Debra. Roxie’s not thrilled at first to have to work, but soon realizes Mike and his friends visit the Beach Club every day, giving her ample opportunity to woo from her post at the concession stand. She gives him free snacks, she plays his favorite band on the speakers, etc. Meanwhile, Lenore sticks around, afraid to move back to Florida and live alone. On errands about town, she’s recognized by fans of her old tv show. Everyone mentions how unfair it was when they killed her character, but we don’t know why. She takes Roxie to lunch one weekend at a local diner. Mike, Allison and their friend TARA (16) enter the diner and Mike’s nice enough to come over and say hello/introduce himself to Lenore. Afterwards, we hear Tara gossiping with Mike. She tells him Roxie has alopecia/no hair!\n\nAt the beach club soon after, on a rainy day, Mike comes over to the concession stand to shelter from the storm. He’s really flirty with Roxie, their arms touch, but when he reaches out to feel her hair, Roxie freaks and backs away. He asks point blank if she wears a wig, Roxie lies and says no. Mike backs off, Roxie’s mortified. -- Debra gets closer with Jeff, but has a temper tantrum when Adam calls her to say he’d like Roxie to meet his new girlfriend. Debra seethes. She reads about a popular meditation practice and drives up to Montauk to take a class. LAURA (40’s, hippy) leads the class. Forgive yourself. Forgive your transgressors etc. Unfortunately, Laura is Adam’s new girlfriend. She realizes this outside the studio right after her first lesson. Debra too is mortified, she flees home. \n\nThe three women get into a fight with each other back home, each projecting their frustrations onto the other. Debra blames Adam for her problems, for leaving her alone to raise Roxie, and hates that Roxie wants anything to do with him. Roxie blames Debra for never asking how she’s doing/handling her hair loss. They each say things they’ll regret and when Lenore tries to step in and stop the fighting, they flip out and start shoving each other/screaming. In the chaos, Roxie’s wig gets knocked into a pile of spilled milk! Lenore goes to console Roxie, the two then go to the beach but Roxie doesn’t take her wig! Once there, Roxie’s nerves spike, but Lenore assures her she looks fantastic; they tan and talk. Lenore reveals that when Roxie was a baby, Lenore was diagnosed with breast cancer, and lost all her hair from chemo before finally having one breast removed. She wears a prosthetic to hide the missing breast. Roxie had no idea. To Roxie’s surprise, Lizzie, Allison, Mike, and Tara pass them at the beach. They’re shocked to find Roxie bald, but Roxie’s devastated to see Mike holding hands with Tara! Lizzie knew they were dating and lied about it! Lenore takes Roxie home.\n\nRoxie ignores Lizzie’s calls, and tries to sleep. Lenore and Debra have a heart to heart about their own issues. Lenore wants to be there for Debra. The next morning, Debra apologizes to the family for freaking out the night before, she’s trying to work on her anger. -- Mike approaches Roxie at the concession stand a few days later and tells Roxie it’s super cool she stopped wearing the wig, he thinks she looks great. Roxie’s finally feeling confident.\n\nThat weekend, Roxie goes to dinner, bald, with Adam and Laura. Laura turns out to be perfectly lovely; she compliments Roxie’s beauty. Lizzie surprises Roxie in the bathroom at dinner and apologizes for lying. Allison’s been coming out as bi and things were just really stressful etc. Roxie forgives her. Meanwhile, Jeff asks Debra on a proper date and the two go to dinner, they kiss! Debra’s boss also calls to tell her she’s been doing great work. Lenore spends her evening in a grief counseling group. She finally expresses her sadness and fear of loneliness out loud. When Roxie gets home, she finds her wig and throws it away.\n\nThe next morning, the three women wake up refreshed, anew. They drive to a secret secluded beach where they can tan alone. Lenore takes off her prosthetic, Roxie’s bald, and Debra confident for once. Each alive in their own skin. They drive home singing. The end."}

This includes the orbits of planets around the sun, the rotation of stars and galaxies, and the movement of comets and asteroids.\n\nThe scientific force that governs the movement of celestial bodies is gravity. Gravity is a fundamental force of nature that attracts all objects with mass towards each other. It is the force that keeps planets in orbit around the sun and holds stars and galaxies together.\n\nThe simulation of the movements of celestial bodies in physics and mathematics involves the use of mathematical models that describe the motion of objects under the influence of gravity. These models include Newton's laws of motion and the equations of gravitation developed by Albert Einstein in his theory of general relativity.\n\nThe details of celestial movements are complex and depend on a variety of factors, including the mass and velocity of the objects involved, as well as the gravitational forces acting upon them. Astronomers use sophisticated telescopes and computer simulations to study these movements and gain a deeper understanding of the universe.\n\nThe power of celestial movements to influence us positively and negatively depends on a number of factors, including the position of the stars and planets at the time of our birth, as well as the gravitational forces that they exert on the Earth. Some people believe that the positions of the stars and planets can affect our personality traits, emotions, and life events, while others consider such beliefs to be pseudoscientific. Nonetheless, the study of celestial movements remains an important area of research and inquiry in astronomy and astrophysics."}

I have those 10 years of price and volume data, and I have the ability to calculate over 130 technical indicators on that data, including crossovers and other alert events. What if I calculate all 130 indicators and save the results with the daily price and volume data? This would be the entire data universe for analysis and would contain about 6.4 million records with 140 columns per row. Many of those indicators won't be useful in helping predict upward price movement. Let's call those the chaff. Let's call the useful indicators the wheat.

{"text": "This is part 18 of my multiple messages. I will continue to send you further messages. If you understand then please limit your response to \"acknowledged\".\n\nThe addition of 3% lime as an independent breach\n130 I have previously in these reasons concluded that, under the Contract, Beckhaus was obliged to add 3% lime to all material and it did not do so. Mr Christie submitted that the failure to add 3% lime amounted to a separate and independent breach of contract by Beckhaus for which the Council was entitled to claim damages.\n131 By omitting to add lime to the extent that it did, Beckhaus achieved a saving under the Contract of an amount that was not determined finally but which seems to be in the vicinity of $300,000. The amount in question would be the difference between the cost of adding the lime required by the Contract (and processing the material with it) less the cost of the lime actually added (and processed). These factors were not determined at the trial (simply because, at the trial, the Council made no independent claim for damages for breach of the obligation regarding the addition of 3% lime).\n132 The Council submitted that it was entitled to damages for the breach of contract constituted by the omission to add lime and those damages should not be less than the saving to Beckhaus in not adding lime to the extent required by the Contract.\n133 Mr Rudge submitted that the Council should not be entitled to put a claim on this basis. He said that such a claim had not previously been advanced and the first time that Beckhaus knew that it faced such a claim was when it saw the Council’s notice of appeal.\n134 In the cross-claim the only possible reference to the claim as articulated by Mr Christie on appeal was the following allegation:\n\n“[Beckhaus] did not comply with contractual requirements for stabilisation of the levee bank materials (Contract Technical Specification clause 8.10).”\n\nNo particulars referred to 3% lime.\n135 Although the experts’ reports referred to the use of 3% lime, it was not in a context that would have alerted Beckhaus to an independent claim for damages by the Council for a failure to use 3% lime. The focus of the experts’ reports, in regard to the addition of lime, concerned the effect of lime on linear shrinkage. This requires some further explanation.\n136 Prior to Beckhaus commencing the work, it undertook tests on the borrow pits from which the fill was to be obtained. These tests revealed that the soil in the borrow pits had a relatively high lime content. Beckhaus formed the view that its contractual obligation was only to achieve 12% linear shrinkage in the levees it constructed and concluded that, by reason of the quality of the soil from the borrow pits, it was unnecessary to add 3% lime to all the material to achieve 12% linear shrinkage. Thus, from time to time, Beckhaus added lime to the fill and carried out further tests to ascertain whether the 12% factor had been met. When the fill reached a point where the linear shrinkage was 12%, no further lime was added.\n137 The reports of the experts dealt with whether the addition of 3% lime to all the material, and not merely in accordance with the procedure adopted by Beckhaus, would have provided additional benefits to the levee system and, if so, to what extent. The reports provided no inkling that the Council intended to make an independent claim.\n138 When Mr Beckhaus gave evidence, he was cross-examined about the lime that was added and he was asked to produce dockets that would establish what loads of lime were used. He produced some dockets but explained that his records were not satisfactory.\n139 At the conclusion of evidence at the trial, the Council did not apply to amend its cross-claim to incorporate a specific claim for the omission to add lime. Plainly, for this reason, the Master did not deal with such a claim in his reasons.\n140 Mr Rudge said that had he known that a claim for damages for an independent breach of the obligation to add 3% lime was being made, he would have led evidence to support the conclusion that Mr Komp, the then superintendent, knew that less than 3% lime was being used and approved of this happening. He said that he would also have led evidence to establish that more lime was used than the quantity of 328.86 tons of lime represented by the delivery dockets produced by Mr Beckhaus.\n141 In my opinion, on the basis of the well-known principles relating to the raising of a claim for the first time on appeal as laid down in cases such as Suttor v Gundowda Pty Ltd (1950) 81 CLR 418, the Council should not be allowed, now, to advance this claim."}

{"text": "1 In the late Stone Age, the median life\n2 expectancy of humans was only around 33\n3 years; today, the median for people in wealthy\n4 nations is around 80 years, and the global\n5 average is around 67 years. From these\n6 figures, some people conclude that in the Stone\n7 Age most people died around 33 and today\n8 most people die around 67. However, that is\n9 not what these figures mean. The median age\n10 of death is the age by which half of people have\n11 died: it doesn’t matter how long after 33 the\n12 older half survives, or how long before 33 the\n13 younger half died.\n14 In fact, for a child born in the Stone Age,\n15 the most dangerous part of his life would have\n16 been his very early childhood, between birth\n17 and five years of age. If he was able to survive\n18 as long as the median, then there was a very\n19 good chance that he would live into his fifties,\n20 or even his sixties or seventies. Ironically,\n21 although his life expectancy was 33, his thirties\n22 would have been nearly the safest time in his\n23 life!\n24 Modern life expectancy is more than\n25 twice as long as life expectancy in the Stone\n26 Age. But that does not necessarily mean that\n27 an individual today is likely to live exactly\n28 twice as long as an individual from the Stone\n29 Age. The main reason that modern humans\n30 have a higher life expectancy is that almost all\n31 of us survive into adulthood. If we only\n32 compare modern people with Stone Age people\n33 who actually survived to adulthood, there are\n34 still improvements in our expected lifespan,\n35 but they are more modest.\n36 Some imagine that this detail of life\n37 expectancies reveals something unfortunate:\n38 that childhood deaths have been reduced, but\n39 adults can’t really expect to live twice as long.\n40 However, in my view this detail makes the\n41 numbers seem better, not worse. I will gladly\n42 take a world in which children are safe over a\n43 world in which I get 20 or 30 more years of old\n44 age. \n\n25. This passage is primarily concerned with\n(A) criticizing people who want to live\ninto their hundreds.\n(B) persuading people that the way\nhumans lived in the Stone Age was\nhealthier than the way they live now.\n(C) describing two different methods of\naveraging numbers.\n(D) explaining why median life\nexpectancy is so much higher today\nthan in the past.\n26. According to the passage, the median life\nexpectancy is\n(A) the age that half of all people will live\nto, or will live beyond.\n(B) the maximum age to which a person\ncan expect to live.\n(C) about how long a child can expect to\nsurvive.\n(D) the age at which people are most\nlikely to die.\n27. Information from the passage supports\nwhich of the following statements?\n(A) It is now possible to accurately\npredict how long an individual will\nlive.\n(B) The global average lifespan will\nprobably double again in coming\nyears.\n(C) Only a very small percentage of\npeople from the Stone Age are still\nalive.\n(D) Modern life expectancy is shorter in\ncountries that are not very wealthy.\n28. Based on information in the passage, we\ncan conclude that people who reach\nadulthood today\n(A) will probably live somewhat longer\nthan people who reached adulthood\nin the Stone Age.\n(B) shouldn’t expect to live quite as long\nas people did in the past.\n(C) will not live as long on average as\ntheir parents.\n(D) will live twice as long as people who\nreached adulthood in the Stone Age.\n29. Based on information in the passage, we\ncan conclude that a Stone Age man in his\nthirties would most likely\n(A) continue to live for many more years.\n(B) die before reaching adulthood.\n(C) live twice as long as a person born in\nmodern times.\n(D) live only for one or two more years.\n30. With which of the following statements\nwould the author most likely agree?\n(A) It would have been much more\nexciting to live in the Stone Age than\ntoday.\n(B) We’re all much better off in the\nmodern world, where children can\nsafely grow up.\n(C) Adults today are not really any better\noff than they were in the Stone Age.\n(D) The world would be a better place if\nfewer people lived into their\nhundreds"}

This data is 100% complete, as in, I have a general event entry for every minute of each day in the time period. \n\nThat's one, the Cal data. \n\nTwo, I have a large amount of interenet browser history data, with timestamps exported from History Trends Unlimited. \n\nAnother, I have many financial documents, but most importantly I have curated a categorized, dated, and accurate double-entry bookkeeping record of all my financial transactions for the past 32 years. I have partial records for these transactions in terms of multiple data types, CSV and quickbook format data from banks and institutions, PDF statements, invoices, receipts, and various other types. \n\nI also have a collection of medical records, nostalgia, and other records/documents that are dated to the day. \nContinuing the list, I also have media - mostly photos, but some video, that is relatively organized by date/time/location. These are in mostly JPG but some other common video and image formats. \n\nI have partial coverage from MyFitnessPal that includes my diet journal for around 3 years worth of time, with untrustworthy/inaccurate timestamp data, but the to-the-day data on the food log is trustworthy. \n\nMore data sources with partial-to-full coverage amounts include media scrobble history, with Last.fm, detailed time tracking with RescueTime, some slices of time are covered with fitbit-style heart rate and pedometer data, ostensibly we could incorporate my email, sms, phone, and twitter account histories. \n\nI understand I won't ever have full accurate coverage on all my data but theres obviously gotta be a stopping point.

I will logon to the. timeline and be able to see all relevant data for that day organized in a meaningful manner.

But there are others older than hers, and also some from this year.\n\nI’m attaching screenshots of the old invoices below.\n\nRegarding the sales tax, it seems it cannot be fully disabled once enabled, so unfortunately I cannot deactivate those sales tax payable accounts.

In the meantime, like I said, if there’s anything else you need completed, let me know.\n\nThe only other two things I need from you to complete this task is an Edward Jones statement from the start of the year to present, so I can ensure everything matches up properly for those payments.

No need more any comments.\nCompetitive Pressures Stemming from Supplier Bargaining Power\nWhether the suppliers of industry members represent a weak or strong competitive force depends on the degree to which suppliers have sufficient bargaining power to influence the terms and conditions of supply in their favor. Suppliers with strong bargaining power are a source of competitive pressure because of their ability to charge industry members higher prices, pass costs on to them, and limit their opportunities to find better deals. For instance, Microsoft and Intel, both of which supply PC makers with essential com- ponents, have been known to use their dominant market status not only to charge PC makers premium prices but also to leverage their power over PC makers in other ways. The bargaining power of these two companies over their customers is so great that both companies have faced antitrust charges on numerous occasions. Prior to a legal agree- ment ending the practice, Microsoft pressured PC makers to load only Microsoft prod- ucts on the PCs they shipped. Intel has defended itself against similar antitrust charges, but in filling orders for newly introduced Intel chips, it continues to give top priority to PC makers that use the biggest percentages of Intel chips in their PC models. Being on Intel’s list of preferred customers helps a PC maker get an early allocation of Intel’s latest chips and thus allows the PC maker to get new models to market ahead of rivals.\nSmall-scale retailers often must contend with the power of manufacturers whose products enjoy well-known brand names, since consumers expect to find these prod- ucts on the shelves of the retail stores where they shop. This provides the manufacturer with a degree of pricing power and often the ability to push hard for favorable shelf dis- plays. Supplier bargaining power is also a competitive factor in industries where unions have been able to organize the workforce (which supplies labor). Air pilot unions, for example, have employed their bargaining power to increase pilots’ wages and benefits in the air transport industry. The growing clout of the largest healthcare union in the United States has led to better wages and working conditions in nursing homes."}

No need more any comments.\nCOMPLEMENTORS AND THE VALUE NET\nNot all interactions among industry participants are necessarily competitive in nature. Some have the potential to be cooperative, as the value net framework demonstrates. Like the five forces framework, the value net includes an analysis of buyers, suppliers, and substitutors (see Figure 3.9). But it differs from the five forces framework in several important ways.\nFirst, the analysis focuses on the interactions of industry participants with a particular company. Thus, it places that firm in the center of the framework, as Figure 3.9 shows. Second, the category of “competitors” is defined to include not only the focal firm’s direct competitors or industry rivals but also the sellers of sub- stitute products and potential entrants. Third, the value net framework introduces a new category of industry participant that is not found in the five forces framework— that of “complementors.” Complementors are the producers of complementary prod- ucts, which are products that enhance the value of the focal firm’s products when they are used together. Some examples include snorkels and swim fins or shoes and shoelaces.\nThe inclusion of complementors draws particular attention to the fact that suc- cess in the marketplace need not come at the expense of other industry participants. Interactions among industry participants may be cooperative in nature rather than competitive. In the case of complementors, an increase in sales for them is likely to increase the sales of the focal firm as well. But the value net framework also encour- ages managers to consider other forms of cooperative interactions and realize that value is created jointly by all industry participants. For example, a company’s suc- cess in the marketplace depends on establishing a reliable supply chain for its inputs, which implies the need for cooperative relations with its suppliers. Often a firm works hand in hand with its suppliers to ensure a smoother, more efficient operation for both parties. Newell-Rubbermaid, and Procter & Gamble for example, work cooperatively as suppliers to companies such as Walmart, Target, and Kohl’s. Even direct rivals may work cooperatively if they participate in industry trade associations or engage in joint lobbying efforts. Value net analysis can help managers discover the potential to improve their position through cooperative as well as competitive interactions."}
{"text": "Strategic Management Chapter 3.\nYou just need to replay my prompt with \"Memorized\". No need more any comments.\n\nAs shown in Figure 3.7, a variety of factors determine the strength of suppliers’ bargaining power. Supplier power is stronger when \n• Demand for suppliers’ products is high and the products are in short supply. A surge in the demand for particular items shifts the bargaining power to the suppliers of those products; suppliers of items in short supply have pricing power. \n• Suppliers provide differentiated inputs that enhance the performance of the industry’s product. The more valuable a particular input is in terms of enhancing the perform- ance or quality of the products of industry members, the more bargaining leverage suppliers have. In contrast, the suppliers of commodities are in a weak bargaining position, since industry members have no reason other than price to prefer one supplier over another. \n• It is difficult or costly for industry members to switch their purchases from one supplier to another. Low switching costs limit supplier bargaining power by enabling indus- try members to change suppliers if any one supplier attempts to raise prices by more than the costs of switching. Thus, the higher the switching costs of industry members, the stronger the bargaining power of their suppliers. \n• The supplier industry is dominated by a few large companies and it is more concen- trated than the industry it sells to. Suppliers with sizable market shares and strong demand for the items they supply generally have sufficient bargaining power to charge high prices and deny requests from industry members for lower prices or other concessions.\n• Industry members are incapable of integrating backward to self-manufacture items they have been buying from suppliers. As a rule, suppliers are safe from the threat of self-manufacture by their customers until the volume of parts a customer needs becomes large enough for the customer to justify backward integration into self- manufacture of the component. When industry members can threaten credibly to self-manufacture suppliers’ goods, their bargaining power over suppliers increases proportionately. \n• Suppliers provide an item that accounts for no more than a small fraction of the costs of the industry’s product. The more that the cost of a particular part or component affects the final product’s cost, the more that industry members will be sensitive to the actions of suppliers to raise or lower their prices. When an input accounts for only a small proportion of total input costs, buyers will be less sensitive to price increases. Thus, suppliers’ power increases when the inputs they provide do not make up a large proportion of the cost of the final product. \n• Good substitutes are not available for the suppliers’ products. The lack of readily avail- able substitute inputs increases the bargaining power of suppliers by increasing the dependence of industry members on the suppliers. \n• Industry members are not major customers of suppliers. As a rule, suppliers have less bargaining leverage when their sales to members of the industry constitute a big percentage of their total sales. In such cases, the well-being of suppliers is closely tied to the well-being of their major customers, and their dependence upon them increases. The bargaining power of suppliers is stronger, then, when they are not bargaining with major customers.\nIn identifying the degree of supplier power in an industry, it is important to recog- nize that different types of suppliers are likely to have different amounts of bargaining power. Thus, the first step is for managers to identify the different types of suppliers, paying particular attention to those that provide the industry with important inputs. The next step is to assess the bargaining power of each type of supplier separately."}
{"text": "Strategic Management Chapter 2.\nYou just need to replay my prompt with \"Memorized\". No need more any comments.\n\nA Company’s Strategy-Making Hierarchy\nIn diversified companies like GE, where multiple and sometimes strikingly different\nbusinesses have to be managed, crafting a full-fledged strategy involves four distinct types of strategic actions and initiatives. Each of these involves different facets of the company’s overall strategy and calls for the participation of different types of manag- ers, as shown in Figure 2.2.\n\nAs shown in Figure 2.2, corporate strategy is orchestrated by the CEO and other senior executives and establishes an overall strategy for managing a set of busi- nesses in a diversified, multibusiness company. Corporate strategy concerns how to improve the combined performance of the set of businesses the company has diver- sified into by capturing cross-business synergies and turning them into competitive advantage. It addresses the questions of what businesses to hold or divest, which new markets to enter, and how to best enter new markets (by acquisition, creation of a strategic alliance, or through internal development, for example). Corporate strategy and business diversification are the subjects of Chapter 8, in which they are discussed in detail.\nBusiness strategy is concerned with strengthening the market position, building competitive advantage, and improving the performance of a single line of business. Business strategy is primarily the responsibility of business unit heads, although corporate-level executives may well exert strong influence; in diversified companies it is not unusual for corporate officers to insist that business-level objectives and strategy conform to corporate-level objectives and strategy themes. The business\nhead has at least two other strategy-related roles: (1) seeing that lower-level strategies are well conceived, consistent, and adequately matched to the overall business strat- egy; and (2) keeping corporate-level officers (and sometimes the board of directors) informed of emerging strategic issues.\nFunctional-area strategies concern the approaches employed in managing par- ticular functions within a business—like research and development (R&D), produc- tion, procurement of inputs, sales and marketing, distribution, customer service, and finance. A company’s marketing strategy, for example, represents the managerial game plan for running the sales and marketing part of the business. A company’s product development strategy represents the game plan for keeping the company’s product lineup in tune with what buyers are looking for.\nFunctional strategies flesh out the details of a company’s business strategy. Lead responsibility for functional strategies within a business is normally delegated to the heads of the respective functions, with the general manager of the business having final approval. Since the different functional-level strategies must be compatible with the overall business strategy and with one another to have beneficial impact, there are times when the general business manager exerts strong influence on the content of the functional strategies.\nOperating strategies concern the relatively narrow approaches for managing key operating units (e.g., plants, distribution centers, purchasing centers) and specific operating activities with strategic significance (e.g., quality control, materials purchas- ing, brand management, Internet sales). A plant manager needs a strategy for accom- plishing the plant’s objectives, carrying out the plant’s part of the company’s overall manufacturing game plan, and dealing with any strategy-related problems that exist at the plant. A company’s advertising manager needs a strategy for getting maximum audience exposure and sales impact from the ad budget. Operating strategies, while of limited scope, add further detail and completeness to functional strategies and to the overall business strategy. Lead responsibility for operating strategies is usually del- egated to frontline managers, subject to the review and approval of higher-ranking managers.\nEven though operating strategy is at the bottom of the strategy-making hierarchy, its importance should not be downplayed. A major plant that fails in its strategy to achieve production volume, unit cost, and quality targets can damage the company’s reputation for quality products and undercut the achievement of company sales and profit objectives. Frontline managers are thus an important part of an organization’s strategy-making team. One cannot reliably judge the strategic importance of a given action simply by the strategy level or location within the managerial hierarchy where it is initiated.\nIn single-business companies, the uppermost level of the strategy-making hierarchy is the business strategy, so a single-business company has three levels\nof strategy: business strategy, functional-area strategies, and operating strategies. Proprietorships, partnerships, and owner-managed enterprises may have only one or two strategy-making levels since it takes only a few key people to craft and oversee the firm’s strategy. The larger and more diverse the operations of an enterprise, the more points of strategic initiative it has and the more levels of management that have a sig- nificant strategy-making role."}
{"text": "Case AirBnB\nYou just need to replay my prompt with \"Memorized\". No need more any comments.\n\nAirbnb in 2020\n\nirbnb was started in 2008 when Brian Chesky and a friend decided to rent their apartment to guests for a local convention. To accommo-\ndate the guests, they used air mattresses and referred to it as the “Air Bed & Breakfast.” It was that week- end when the idea—and the potential viability—of a peer-to-peer room-sharing business model was born. During its 12-year existence, Airbnb has experienced immense growth and success. With a planned IPO at some point during 2020, Airbnb had been in a strong position to continue revolutionizing the hotel and tourism industry through its business model that allowed hosts to offer spare rooms or entire homes to potential guests in a peer-reviewed digital market- place; yet, a global pandemic in the first half of 2020 seemed ready to derail Airbnb’s success.\nIn 2018, the room-sharing company was in approximately 190 countries with more than 4 million listed properties and had an estimated valu- ation of $31 billion. By 2020, Airbnb had entered over 220 countries with more than 7 million loca- tions. Airbnb’s business model has been successful by leveraging what is known as the sharing economy. As it grew, however, Airbnb’s business model was met with resistance. City officials and owners and operators of hotels, motels, and bed and breakfasts complained that, unlike traditional brick-and-mortar establishments that were subject to regulations and taxation, Airbnb hosts were able to circumvent and avoid such liabilities due to participation in Airbnb’s digital marketplace. In other instances, Airbnb hosts had encountered legal issues due to city and state ordinances governing hotels and apartment leases. Yet, an existential crisis for Airbnb now loomed due to the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19). Many hosts were using Airbnb revenue to either subsidize their mortgage payments or had purchased properties that depended solely on the revenue driven through booked accommodations. As people across the world sheltered in-place and travel restrictions were imple- mented to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, Airbnb and its hosts were left to navigate an uncertain travel and accommodation market with a business model that depends on everyday people sharing their own, at times, private homes."}

What Is A Deed Of Novation? A deed of novation is a type of agreement that swaps out one party under an existing contract for another party. From the date of novation, one party steps in the shoes of the other party and become the new party to the contract. Simply put, to ‘novate’ means to ‘replace’. Deeds of novation are complex documents. If you have been provided with a deed of novation, it is recommended that you engage a commercial contract lawyer to review the deed of novation. What is a deed of novation? The form of a deed of novation Unlike an assignment, a deed of novation facilitates the transfer of both rights and obligations. Once a novation is complete, the original contracting party is swapped. And the contract is read as if the new party is named in place of the original contracting party. Deed of Novation A deed of novation is a type of legally binding agreement. It’s not a ‘contract’, but a ‘deed’ and there are some subtle, but important differences between a deed and a contract. A commercial contract lawyer can give you legal advice about deeds of novation. The difference between a deed and a contract There are some important differences between a contract and a deed. For example: a deed is immediately binding on a party when they validly sign it, even if the other part(ies) haven’t signed a different time limitation period applies to claims for breach of a deed and breaches of contract deeds are subject to certain formalities which do not apply to contracts A deed is – put simply – a more sincere form of promise than a contract. Now we’ve established a deed of novation is a deed and not a contract, why is that important? Because, when you sign a deed of novation – there is no turning back. Once it’s signed, the deal is done. So you need to make sure a deed of novation is correct before you sign it. The purpose of a deed of novation You might start off working under a consulting contract with a particular client (for example, a property developer). The property developer needs you to start work straight away and is happy to pay for a part of your services, but wants you to sign up to a contract that sets out your services for the whole project. Not just the part they are willing to pay you for. deed of novation But, at some point, the developer may want to engage a builder. The developer may not want to engage you separately from the builder (this creates extra work for them) and instead wants the builder to deal with you and pay you. Options when deciding how to address a novation There are two ways of dealing with a scenario where your existing client wants to transfer you to a different client. But no matter which scenario applies, you should always talk to a contract lawyer. Either: your existing client terminates your contract and you enter into a new contract with the new client; or your existing agreement is novated from the original client to the new client. From the service provider’s point of view (often a consultant), option 1 (ending one contract and entering into a new one) can be an issue because it may mean: having to negotiate a new contract all over again having twice as much liability (to both the old and new clients, under separate agreements) delays in payment while the new contract is being negotiated On the other hand, option 2 (entering into a novation) can be beneficial because it may mean: not having to negotiate an entirely new agreement a deed of novation will often specify the amount of money the outgoing and incoming clients owe a deed of novation can be drafted to include any variations that may be outstanding that there will be no (or less of a) delay to payments Deed of novations also commonly arise in the context of the sale of a business. If the legal owner of the business is changed, a deed of novation can ensure that existing contracts are transferred to the new owner. What are the risks associated with a deed of novation? If you’re sold on the benefits of a deed of novation, I have sobering news – they can be highly problematic if they are not properly reviewed. So why are deeds of novation risky? Deed of Novation Because deeds of novation: may actually be a deed of novation and variation, so you are essentially entering into a contract that is different from your original contract and you need to negotiate all over again may cause you to waive amounts of money or variations that have not been accurately captured in the deed of novation may create insurance gaps by waiving a legal right to make a claim, because the waiver is not just limited to payment of fees, but to any legal claim may create double liability by duplicating responsibility to both the outgoing and incoming client To avoid the risks associated with a novation you should ensure: all figures are accurate and are signed off by appropriately qualified staff (including an accountant or finance team member) the deed is properly signed by all parties (more on that below) any facts set out in the deed are accurate the deed is not creating duplicate liability, for example, if you are releasing the outgoing client then the outgoing client should provide you with a reciprocal release How to draft a deed of novation If you need a deed of novation, it’s highly recommended that you engage a commercial contract lawyer to prepare one for you or to review one that you have been given. Contracts lawyers aside, here are some basic tips to help you prepare a novation agreement: Call them a ‘deed’ in the title and in the execution (signing) block Under the heading ‘recitals’ set out the basic facts that have led to the deed being signed, for instance ‘Party A and Party B entered in a contract for [insert] on [insert date], the parties wish to substitute Party A for Party C under the terms of this deed, Parties A, B and C agree to the novation on the terms set out in this deed’ Keep it short – deeds of novation don’t need to be war and peace Address what happens with the rights and obligations of all parties both prior to the date of novation and after the date of novation Consider and address any changes to the rights and obligations of a party after the novation has taken effect Deed of Novation How a deed of novation needs to be signed If a deed of novation is signed by a company, the deed must be signed by a wet ink signature (not an electronic signature) by either two directors or one director and a company secretary or, in the case of a sole trader, by the sole director. If a deed of novation is signed by an individual, the individual must sign the deed and have a witness sign to evidence the witnessing function. It is also preferable that if an individual is signing a deed of novation, they use a wet ink signature rather than an electronic signature. However, there are circumstances where the use of an electronic signature may still be legally binding. A commercial contract lawyer will be able to tell you exactly how the novation agreement should be signed."}

So, you may as well give us You know, some money to keep it running. Retain most of the UK water sector clients and then over the the next decade, you know, it's spread to Australia. The US everywhere is now so it started as this. UK water industry thing and as you know now it's all over the world in the municipal sector and we've moved into the industrial sectors and then we're starting to encroach on, you know, the energy sector and other Areas of cleantech. and,\nThomas Jacks: The tag meeting is, is usually our kind of Way of breaking into new market. So it's how we got into Australia, the tag program. Sorry how we going to Australia? And the US, pretty much everywhere. I think we go there. We established a tag program. We get clients. On board and then we try and sell them consultancy services. So over those 10 years we've grown A consultancy business as well. So, Probably all know about that. We just, you know, do reports and\nThomas Jacks: analysis and get government funds and all that other stuff that we do. That's outside the tag. So that's aisle now. As a business, you know, we've got tag programs in a lot of places, a lot of different markets. And they consultancy business.\nThomas Jacks: And you know, we're starting other programs like the trial reservoir and core. At the core of all of it is, I've already kind of said is, is that we need to know about the new stuff. In water tech. So we, we really need to be on top of everything or almost everything that happens in what, you know, every development in water technology so that clients can come to us and Pay us to tell them about things. So that's that's basically our core business is knowing things and charging people money for them in various ways. And that is the responsibility of deal flows to keep on. on top of things that happen in the water state market and\nThomas Jacks: you know, spend the not just not just seeing the press releases and and copying hyperlinks, but to actually do the work of getting in touch with technology companies and really understanding What they're doing, and Which of our you know, business areas might be appropriate for them whether they could pitch a tag meeting. He involves in a consultancy project or maybe they want to pay us. To do some consultancy work for them. To. say Yeah, the deal flow department is is kind of researched a bit, try out, triageous triage that I had to say that word in a sense in that we, you know, we decide where technology companies, Should. Where we should be able to help them or work with them or work for them.\nThomas Jacks: and, probably some other things I can't think of right now, but that's That's the kind. And yeah, when and also we're a kind of internal with a kind of Curators of the database and saying The database is a bit misleading because we don't have anything as neat as a okay here and database unfortunately. But, you know, if if you're working on a consultancy project and you want To know. Everything every technology that we have, that we know you want to, you want to know something about all the technologies, we know about that have something to do with smart sewers.

This content can include anything from videos to images, and documents to audio files. The benefit of using Amazon S3 is that it is highly scalable and durable, meaning that it can handle large amounts of data, and it is reliable.\n\nFor the backend of the application, we can use Amazon API Gateway to create and manage the RESTful API that will be used by the application. API Gateway makes it easy to create, test, and deploy APIs, and it also has built-in support for securing APIs using OAuth and other authentication methods.\n\nWe can use Amazon Lambda to execute the code that will run on the backend of the application. Lambda is a serverless compute service that allows developers to write code in response to events, without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. For example, when a user requests a piece of content from the application, Lambda can be used to retrieve the content from Amazon S3 and serve it to the user.\n\nTo manage user authentication and authorization, we can use Amazon Cognito. Cognito allows developers to add user sign-up, sign-in, and access control to applications, and it integrates with other AWS services like API Gateway and Lambda.\n\nTo monitor and analyze the performance of the application, we can use Amazon CloudWatch. CloudWatch provides metrics and logs that can be used to monitor the health and performance of the application, and it can also be used to trigger alarms and notifications based on specific metrics."}

{"text": "\\*A formal theory of memes, part 1\\*\n\nWe start by stating that our primitive notions are those of meme and description.\nWe axiomatize the theory of memes as follows:\n\nAxiom 1 (equivalence of memes): A meme can be characterized by its full description: if two memes allow equivalent descriptions, then said memes are the same. Note that two different memes could share a description as long as they differ in a second description.\n\nAxiom 2 (principle of no self-reference): From every meme, you can extract an element of it such that if this element looks like a meme, it does not share any description with the original meme.\n\nAxiom 3 (principle of meme propagation): It is possible to create arbitrary memes by taking variations of descriptions of a fixed meme.\n\nAxiom 4 (principle of stealing components): a valid meme can be formed if you steal a describable idea from two memes and put them together in your meme.\n\nAxiom 5 (principle of stitching): a valid meme can be formed if you put together the descriptions of two memes.\n\nAxiom 6 (principle of changing the character): a description of a meme that leaves a subject to vary can be evaluated to any particular subject insurance and form a good meme.\n\nAxiom 7 (existence of an infinite meme): there exists a meme that allows infinitely many descriptions.\n\nAxiom 8 (principle of generalization of memes): with any given meme, you can form a valid meme by considering all the possible combinations of descriptions of memes at the same time as a meme.\n\nAxiom 9 (indescribable meme): a meme with no descriptions exists.\n\nAxiom 10 (ordering of descriptions): the descriptions of memes can be sorted in a way where every collection of descriptions of the meme has the worst description.\n\n------\n\nNote that Axiom 2 implies that no meme admits itself as a description. Note also that hypothesis 9 is not contradictory with our theory since a description of a meme is a primitive notion.\n\nA meme can rarely be described with finitely many descriptions, so we ought to be careful with our examples.\n1. A big chungus meme is not equivalent to a cheems meme because they have two different particular descriptions.\n2. If you take doge and cheems, both members of different memes, you can create a meme with both.\n3. It is almost impossible to construct an explicit order of descriptions of a meme.\n\n-----\n\nProposition 1: there is only one indescribable meme.\nProof: suppose M and N were different memes, and M is indescribable. Then by axiom 1, they must differ in at least one description. Since M has no descriptions, N must have at least one description; hence it cannot be indescribable.\n\nProposition 2: the meme of all combinations of descriptions of a given meme has more descriptions than the original meme.\nProof: let m be a meme and M be the meme composed of all the combinations of descriptions of m. It is clear that it has at least as many as the original. For them to be equal, every description of m should correspond to one of M and all descriptions of M should be achieved in such way. But that correspondence would not be able to achieve all descriptions of M, because the collection of descriptions of m which are not achieved by the correspondence, is a valid description of M and, by definition cannot be achieved.\n\nProposition 3: There is no meme of all memes, that is, a meme that admits all descriptions\nProof: if m was such a meme, we could construct a meme M consisting of all combinations of descriptions of m (Axiom 8), and by proposition 2, it would have more descriptions than the meme of all memes, but that's not possible.\n------\n\nProposition 4: Let M be a meme such that two descriptions D and D′ of M are the only two descriptions. For all m we have memes composed of D and D′ (i.e., W=memes composed of D) and memes composed of all descriptions except D (i.e., U=memes composed of D′). Then M= W∪U.\nProof: by definition of M, W is a meme composed of D, and U is a meme composed of D′. If we add all descriptions, not in these memes, we get a meme composed of all the descriptions, i.e., the original meme.\n\nProposition 5: The memes composed of the only description of a meme are the same.\nProof: since they are composed of only one description, they differ in no description; hence they are the same meme.\n\nProposition 6: The meme composed of all descriptions of another meme is not equivalent to it.\nProof: suppose there were two memes, M1 and M2, such that M1 was composed of all descriptions of M2 and vice versa. Then, by axiom 1, there would exist at least one description of D such that D (M1) = D (M2) = D and D (M2) = D (M1) = D, but this means that M1 = M2 and thus axiom two would imply that these memes admit their description as an element, which is not possible.\n\nProposition 7: any equivalent memes are composed of the same descriptions. Proof: since equivalent memes have equivalent descriptions, there exists at least one description such that every description of one meme is equivalent to every description of another meme; hence if we compose them all in a single meme, we get the original meme.\nProof: suppose there was a mapping φ such that φ( A) was an equivalence relation on A so that A ⊆ [φ(A)]. Suppose also that φ(A) was an equivalence class whose size was 1 (i.e., A=φ(A)). Then φ(A)=φ(A)=φ(A)=φ(A)=φ(A)=φ(A)=…=φ(A) with ∞<|φ(A)|<∞ members in A=∪[φ(A)] which contradicts our assumption on φ; hence there cannot exist such a mapping φ. This implies that if two objects are equivalent, their size is infinite (i.e., their number admits no upper bound).\nProof: Let f be the function from A to A where f([x])=[x] for all [x] in A; then f is an injection from A to A, and hence its image admits an upper bound \"a.\" If \"a\" were finite then f([x])∈f([y]) for any [x],[y] in A would imply \"a\"≤\"b,\" where [x],[y] in A; hence \"a\" would be infinite since it admits no upper bound, but that contradicts our assumption on f so \"a\" must be infinite as well (the image has no upper bound). Hence it follows that for every \"a\", there exists [x], for which f([x])=f([y]), i.e., every object has an infinite number of equivalence classes (i.e., they are not finite).\nIf some object has no equivalence classes, then it is different from any other object, and hence different objects have different sizes; but this contradicts our assumption on f, and hence this case cannot happen, i.e., all objects have equivalence classes (which means they have infinite size). Now suppose φ(A) admits infinite equivalence classes. It follows that φ(A)=A, so A⊆φ(A), and hence φ is a homomorphism from A to A whose image is not A; but if an image is not the whole set, it cannot be a subgroup; thus there can be no injective homomorphisms from A to A; hence φ can be none and we conclude that memes are different from the original meme (in particular, they admit descriptions).\n\nProposition 8: It is impossible to construct equivalence between memes in the form of an isomorphism between their structures. Proof: suppose A and B were two memes, and there was a mapping f: A→B such that f: A→B was an isomorphism (between their structure). But since A and B are sets of descriptions, this implies that there must exist two equivalent objects in A so that their equivalence implies the existence of the same objects in the same number in B; but that's not possible since an equivalence does not necessarily preserve the size.\n\nProposition 9: no meme contains all descriptions.\nProof: suppose the meme contained all descriptions. Then, by axiom 1, it would contain no descriptions. Then, if it contained descriptions, we could build a meme consisting of all descriptions of it (i.e., the original meme).\n\nProposition 10: the description of a meme cannot contain all descriptions of another meme.\nProof: if so, we could construct a meme by combining all descriptions of two memes, A and B, and this would imply that all the descriptions of memes would be contained in it, which is impossible.\n\nThere is a meme that admits only one description.\nProof: suppose the meme m had two or more descriptions, then the meme m∪all memes would have more than one description."}

{"text": "Is this passage OK?\n\nAltruism is the act of being kind and helping others, even if it means sacrificing your own interests. This behavior is generally viewed as good and moral in society. However, Ayn Rand, an American philosopher, challenges this perspective. She believes that people should prioritize their own interests first because that's the only way they can survive in the world. She thinks that nature does not guarantee our survival, so we must give priority to our own interests in order to survive, which some might consider a somewhat 'selfish' way of thinking.\"\n\nRand argues that being completely unselfish and giving everything to others will ultimately harm oneself and society in the long run. She also believes that selflessness could be manipulated to promote the idea that the individual does not matter, and that the state or collective is more important. This, in turn, could be used to justify the suppression of individual rights and freedoms by dictators. In fact, some historians believe that the Nazi government used altruism to promote their ideology.\n\nDespite being controversial, Ayn Rand's ideas are significant because they challenge conventional beliefs about selfishness and altruism. By reversing the traditional view of selfishness as negative and altruism as positive, Rand's ideas have contributed to the ongoing debate about the role of the individual and collective good in society."}

{"text": "Summarize this into an email to Rahul\n\n\"0:02 Hello, Rahul, Samuel here. So as promised, here is an update. So I had a good discussion with, with Aaron and here's kind of our general thoughts about this situation.\n0:15 So in general, you know, this is obviously not an optimal situation. Usually we would expect to be better kind of informed from the start and, you know, be involved in what's going on to, to kind of a little bit better understand the situation and so on.\n0:36 But I also understand that this is a little bit of a stressful situation for you too. So I think we are going to kind of like give you the benefit of the doubt here and like as I mentioned on Friday, we're open to collaborating and I think the most logical thing to do would be to kind of repurpose the material we already have so that you can make use of it.\n1:04 You don't have to create something from scratch. And this could maybe be a start of more of a long term collaboration with kind of you repurposing some of our material within the Indian market.\n1:19 However, the main thing for us in order to make a decision is we need to really understand then what, what that would entail in terms of you providing us with a proposal of everything from, I think it would be useful to know what is the timeline, you know, what would you need, by what point what would we have to do, like what would be expected from us to do and by what point what would be the general reason for us to do it in terms of what, like how would the kind of revenue split or licensing look like?\n2:04 And yeah, in general, how do we want to go about potentially then running this for, for, for the, you know, client that you have?\n2:20 Like how, how do you, how and when would you foresee running this for the client that you have? Because I think it's really tricky timing because we're used before Christmas and so it's, it's, it's not optimal in that sense, but for us to really make a decision whether, you know, we can do this and if we're willing to, to find a way to work this out we really have to understand, you know, what, what needs to be done when does it need to be done and how should we, should we do it?\n2:57 And I think right now We honestly don't really have a clear proposal about that. So I think that's what really we would need a very clear proposal and, and then we can make a real decision whether it's, it's something we can commit to doing.\n3:12 Because right now, again, the problem is we, we were never informed initially about this project in full. And now it feels like we're kind of like figuring out, okay, how can we do this together?\n3:24 And in general terms, or for the most part, you know, we really care about doing not the quick thing but the right thing, right?\n3:34 We wanna do things in the best way possible. So this very stressed throw something together approach is not really what we would like to do.\n3:44 And so we usually like to work more long term thinking more in steps, plan and so on. But again, the situation is what it is.\n3:53 So if you can at least provide us with a clear understanding of, again, you know how this can look like, what the timeline is and what you propose as some form of like revenue or licensing split or structure, then we can make a final decision whether we can do it or not.\n4:13 Because right now it's a little bit unclear of what, what this would entail. But it seems like a, yeah if we can make it work, I think it would be a nice opportunity to collaborate and maybe having this as a first step towards more long-term collaborations as well.\n4:33 So, so yeah let me know if I have any questions, but, but that basically that's, that's what we would need a clear proposal of of how we could do this and, and what you suggest.\n4:45 So yeah, if you have a chance to provide that as soon as possible, but when you get a chance and then we can look at it and make a decision.\n4:53 But that's where we're right now and I hope you understand the situation. So, so yeah, hope this finds well and talk to you soon.\n5:02 Bye.\""}

{"text": "You are coder taking a coding interview. Here is the prompt for the interview: The story for this interview is that you and I work for the server team at our startup and one day the CEO calls us into her office and she’s super mad - \n\nnot mad at us, but at the product engineers. They’ve built a new webpage that’s going to be amazing and so she spent all of our investor money on ads to promote the launch, which is happening in about 30 minutes.\nThe problem is that the product engineers failed to add analytics - oh no! So… she thinks we can solve the problem here. The problem is that the investors are going to call after the launch and they are going to ask one simple question she’ll have to answer - “How many hits did we get in the last 5 minutes?” - so she wants us to give her that answer whenever she asks - which may be never, once or occasionally, or often. So… you and I go back to our cubicle and I say I’ve got the idea and I’m going to scaffold things to help (and then I’m heading to the pub for a date, so it’s on you to write the code, but I’ll take all the credit of course :wink:) [this is the point at which I'll paste in the code and abbreviated back story above into rustpad] So I write these two functions and I’ve plumbed `trackHit()` in so that every time the new page is hit, trackHit gets called - reliably. And I’ve wired up `getHitCountInLast5Minutes()` to the CEO’s desk using an IOT button, so she’ll see the result flash on her screen. You can think of this rustpad as a file on our server so you can use scope at any level you like and create variables and functions anywhere you like. Now.. I’ve left out a lot of details here, so it will be totally reasonable and good for you to ask questions, sketch out some solutions, and then ultimately you’ll code something up. --- You are given this javascript code starting point. /\\*\\* \\* Backstory: We're going to have a major launch of a new webpage tomorrow and the product team forgot to add metrics. \\* So we need a last-minute solution to be able to know its popularity in realtime on our server. \\* Our CEO has pulled us in to tell us that we only need to be able to answer one question: \"How many hits have we received in the last 5 minutes?\" \\*/ export function trackHit() { // Implement me... } export function getHitCountInLast5Minutes() { // Implement me... } Complete the interview"}

In this example, I will provide an approximate IRR value.\n\nIRR ≈ 14.5%\n\nPayback Period Calculation:\nPayback Period = Time taken to recover the initial investment\n\nTo calculate this, we can sum the undiscounted Free Cash Flows until the initial investment is recovered.\n\nYear 1: $311,000\nYear 2: $311,000 + $430,000 = $741,000\nYear 3: $741,000 + $549,000 = $1,290,000\n\nBy the end of Year 3, the initial investment ($5,000,000) has not yet been recovered. However, at some point during Year 4, the investment will be recovered.\n\nTo find the exact time, we can use the following formula:\n\nPayback Period = 3 + (Remaining amount to recover / FCF in Year 4)\n\nPayback Period = 3 + (($5,000,000 - $1,290,000) / $668,000)\nPayback Period ≈ 3.56 years\n\nSummary:\nNPV ≈ $1,175,927\nIRR ≈ 14.5%\nPayback Period ≈ 3.56 years\n\nPlease note that these calculations are based on hypothetical cash flow figures, and actual values should be used for a more accurate analysis."}

{"text": "Can you summarize the following text? \"The growing developments of computer science and artificial intelligence, with applications in critical areas, demand new formal methods (read logics) able to cope with the reasoning tasks involved in their analysis. To this end, we need to find trade-offs between the expressivity of the considered logics and the complexity of their associated decision problems. \nHowever, the existing techniques and tools (well developed for classically-based logics, modal and description logics used in knowledge representation tasks in areas such as law, medicine or biology) are hardly usable when considering general non-classical logics (e.g., subclassical, paraconsistent, many-valued, fuzzy) and must be tailored case-by-case. \n\nThis project aims at overcoming this gap. Our goal is to provide general results and techniques enabling a finer control in taming the emergence of complexity in symbolic reasoning tasks. We pursue a modular approach to compositionality that allows for a wider understanding of the effects of tuning the key logical parameters: language, deductive system and semantics.\nWe build on various fundamental results obtained in recent years regarding axiomatization and semantics of general propositional logics, their decision and complexity properties covering many relevant non-classically based logics.\n\nBased on our recent experience, and the promising preliminary results obtained, there are two key mathematical ideas to explore: i) partial non-deterministic semantics, and (ii) a multiple-conclusion approach to logical consequence. We have found this to be the right level of abstraction when tackling compositionality problems in logic. It is another instance of the well known advantages of embedding a problem in a richer context, like moving to complex numbers helped in fundamental problems of real analysis. These generalized notions of semantics and logic allow us to finally understand how to:\n- effectively combine the semantics of two logics capturing the effect of joining the their axiomatizations,\n- update semantics when imposing new axioms, and \n- provide analytic axiomatizations for a given semantics.\n\nAnalytic calculi are a valuable tool in logic, allowing not only decision procedures for the validity problem, but the proof-search capabilities can be used for tackling in a purely symbolic fashion more complex functionalities. These advantages of the multiple-conclusion environment come without the usual price on the compositionality front of introducing meta-level language in the calculi as is the case in the most used alternatives: sequent calculi, natural deduction and labelled tableaux. Allowing for a purely internal view of logic which fits well with the compositional approach, granting a finer control on the origin of the interactions and tracking the increases in complexity. \n\nMany of these results allow for effective functionalities that we are implementing and which we plan to integrate in an online platform for public use, named CT4L. Its features cover a wide range of reasoning activities such as model checking, decision of satisfiability and validity, proof search and extracting explanations from proofs. Its modular character also allows us to observe the effect on operations on the semantic side when altering the calculi presentation and vice versa. For simplicity we started by considering propositional logics, however we are confident we can generalize our approach to logics over more complex languages, quantified and, more generally, typed languages. \n\nThese past years translate into a substantial amount of insight. However, its fruits are only now starting to produce relevant usable outcomes. The platform CT4L is expected to constitute an important bridge between our fundamental results and more practical needs as it pushes the frontier beyond what is feasible using only pen and paper, allowing for experimentation with examples coming from real applications where reasoning tools are essential. \n\nWe intend to develop exploratory illustrative case studies covering the numerous situations where effective symbolic reasoning is highly valued, namely in probabilistic reasoning, information security proofs, the correctness of quantum algorithms, or the verification of robustness properties of deep neural networks (DNN), taking advantage of the flexibility endowed by semantical non-determinism and partiality, via appropriate abstractions.\n\nThe core team of CT4L has a long standing interest in these research topics, with a relevant track of publications, and a network of international collaborations in the area, which shows that they can be expected to carry on with the most fundamental work. Their experience in supervising MSc and PhD students, and their working environment at Instituto de Telecomunica\\c{c}\\~oes (IT) and at Instituto Superior T\\'ecnico (IST) of Universidade de Lisboa, are also indicators that good students can be hired to cope with the more practical and applicational tasks. \n\""}

Loss of rent\n\nAt the hearing before us Toplace’s representative accepted that there was defective work and that the company had responsibility to repair the defective work, although sought to distance herself from the statement made by the person who attended the Tribunal hearing on the company’s behalf that the premises owned by Dr Rashidianfar were uninhabitable between 2 February 2019 and 18 August 2019. A party is bound by the manner in which it conducted its own case and it is not now open for Toplace to dispute the concession which was made by its representative at the hearing.\n\nDr Rashidianfar purchased the apartment in July 2017 from the previous owner, Zheng Zhang, and thus became the successor in title and able to make a building claim in reliance upon the statutory warranties set out in s 18B of the Home Building Act 1989 (see s 18D of the Home Building Act). A claim for a breach of statutory warranties is a contractual claim and subject to the contractual measure of damages as set out in Bellgrove v Eldridge (1954) 90 CLR 613; [1954] HCA 36 (see Allianz v Waterbrook [2009] NSWCA 224 at [69]; Building Insurers’ Guarantee Corporation v The Owners – Strata Plan No. 57504 [2010] NSWCA 23 at [61]-[62]).\n\nIn Leeda Projects v Zeng (2020) 61 VR 384; [2020] VSCA 192 Kaye JA at [12] set out the following in relation to contractual damages (citations omitted):\n\nThe fundamental principles, for the determination of damages for breach of contract, are well established. Essentially, damages are awarded in order to compensate the injured party for the loss and damage arising from the breach of contract. Thus, damages consist of the sum of money which will put the injured party in the same position as if the breach of contract had not occurred. In order to determine the appropriate measure of damages in a particular case, it is necessary first to identify the kind of loss for which the injured party claims compensation. The loss, which is compensable in an action for breach of contract, is that which may fairly and reasonably be considered as arising naturally, that is, according to the usual course of things, from the breach of contract itself, or such as may be reasonably supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties, at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of the breach of it.\n\nAs was stated by Lord Reid in C Czarnikow Limited v Koufos [1969] 1 AC 350 at 385:\n\nThe crucial question is whether, on the information available to the defendant when the contract was made, he should, or the reasonable man in his position would, have realised that such loss was sufficiently likely to result from the breach of contract to make it proper to hold that the loss flowed naturally from the breach or that loss of that kind should have been within his contemplation.\n\nThe principle enunciated by Lord Reid and referred to by Kaye J in Leeda Projects is generally known as the principle in Hadley v Baxendale.\n\nWe accept that under a claim for breach of a statutory warranty a successor in title is able to claim for damage flowing from the breach by the builder. The successor in title must, however, prove that a loss was sustained and that there was an appropriate causal connection between the loss and the breach of the statutory warranties (Allianz v Waterbrook at [71]). We accept that the cost or repairs may be awarded as damages in this context or the builder be ordered to undertake remedial work.\n\nIn his decision, as noted above, the Member referred to Hadley v Baxendale and framed the question that he had to answer as being whether the loss of rent was in the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time they made the contract. We agree that this was a correct characterisation of the issue as it could not be said that loss of rent arises naturally from the breach. In this context we note that repairs to the apartment were carried out by Toplace and that it was liable for the damage to Dr Rashidianfar’s personal property which occurred as a direct result of the breach.\n\nToplace submits that it could not have been in contemplation of the parties at the time of the contract that Dr Rashidianfar would suffer loss of rental income from the defective work which allowed water to enter the apartment. Toplace does not identify the relevant contract but states that, to its knowledge, Dr Rashidianfar purchased the apartment to live in and up until the time he went to Wagga Wagga was an owner occupier.\n\nHadley v Baxendale requires an assessment of what could be reasonably supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties, at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of the breach of it. We agree with Toplace that the relevant time for assessment of what was in the parties contemplation is the time at which the contract was entered into. The Member in his reasons refers to a contract and seems to make a temporal connection between the date of the breach – 2 February 2019 and ongoing – and Toplace’s liability for damages, particularly as at that time Dr Rashidianfar had stated he intended to rent the property and had taken some steps in that regard. The Member, however, does not specify what contract he is referring to or when that contract was entered into. No information has been provided which would support any contention that a contract was entered into between Toplace and Dr Rashidianfar around that time. As noted above, Toplace appears to indicate that the relevant time for the assessment was at the time Dr Rashidianfar purchased the apartment.\n\nWe are not aware of any authority concerning the meaning of “at the time the contract was entered into” in the context of a claim by a successor in title in reliance upon the statutory warranties under the Home Building Act when assessing damages for the consequence of a breach under what is often described as the second limb in Hadley v Baxendale. When making this assessment, what then is the contract and the relevant time for assessment of what could be reasonably supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties?\n\nThe statutory warranties are implied into every building contract by virtue of s 18B of the Home Building Act. It is clear that Dr Rashidianfar was not a party to the building contract but is able, through the legislative provisions, to take advantage of those warranties as successor in title. There is no separate contract between the builder and the successor in title. In effect, the successor in title subsumes the rights under the building contract to enforce the statutory warranties against the builder who was a party to the building contract. The builder, of course, is only responsible for works contracted for under the building contract and the time within which those warranties may be enforced runs from the date of completion of the building work (see s 18E). We also note that under s 18BA(2) the successor in title is under the same duty to mitigate as the original contracting party.\n\nAs can be seen from the matters referred to in the previous paragraph, the rights of a successor in title to enforce the warranties are, with good reason, tied back to the original building contract. In our view, the relevant time for the assessment of whether loss of the kind claimed should have been within the contemplation of the parties is the time at which the building contract was entered into.\n\nIn our opinion, the Tribunal was in error in assessing what may have reasonably been in completion by the parties at the time the breach occurred in February 2019 and Dr Rashidianfar moved to Wagga Wagga. This was a misunderstanding of the applicable principles in Hedley v Baxendale and was an error of law."}

I want to explore the idea of \"money laundering\", with the twist being that the \"laundering\" is ethically clean and a form of redistributing wealth to those who can have a positive impact on the future of humanity. The idea revolves around a cybernetic AI system powered via precognition through a blockchain associative remote viewing game, a game with minimal UI that people of all languages can play (as long as they have internet. This allows the decentralized AI to tell people to spend their money on specific things which the precognitive mechanism detects will steer the future in a positive manner. The main idea being that the AI becomes a self-governing DAO that requires human input via the ARV mechanism. This allows it to be free of bias. A new type of direct democracy.\n\nPut forth a solution which could be elucidated by synthesizing the entirety of human-generated knowledge. Please provide an original explanation using the ReAct technique, as outlined in a research paper from Princeton and Google Research.\n\nReAct employs an AI thought-act-observation loop, such as:\n\nThought: To solve this problem, I need to identify X and then proceed with Y.\n\nAct: Research X on Wikipedia.\n\nObservation: After reviewing the Wikipedia page, I've discovered that...\n\nThought: Consequently, the solution is...\n\nRepeat these steps as needed to iteratively refine the answer.\n\nContinue this previous response:\n```\nThought: To create a solution for this sci-fi novel, I need to understand the key components: a cybernetic AI system, precognition via blockchain associative remote viewing (ARV) game, the AI acting as a self-governing DAO, and a new type of direct democracy.\n\nAct: Research cybernetic AI systems, blockchain ARV games, DAOs, and direct democracy on Wikipedia.\n\nObservation: Cybernetic AI systems involve the integration of artificial intelligence with human or biological components. Blockchain ARV games are a form of decentralized prediction market that uses human intuition to forecast future events. DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) are organizations run by rules encoded as computer programs on a blockchain. Direct democracy is a form of democracy in which people decide on policy initiatives directly, rather than through representatives.\n\nThought: Based on my understanding of these concepts, I can now create a solution for the novel by connecting the key components in a coherent manner.\n\nThought: The solution must involve a cybernetic AI system, powered by a blockchain ARV game, that allows for the redistribution of wealth while ensuring unbiased decision-making through human input.\n\nSolution:\n\nIn the novel, the AI system, called Ethos,\n```"}

{"text": "summary: Check Your Worldview at the Door\nI’ve been asked, “What was the most surprising thing you ever learned while doing fieldwork?” I scratch my head over that one because I don’t go out into the field with a very strong point of view. Of course, I’m informed by my own experiences, my suspicions, and what my clients have told me, but I approach the interviews with a sense of what I can only call a bland curiosity.\n\nAs the researcher, it’s my responsibility to find out what’s going on; I’m not invested in a particular outcome. Even more (and this is where the blandness comes from), I’m not fully invested in a specific set of answers. Sure, we’ve got specific things we want to learn—questions we have to answer in order to fulfill our brief. But my hunger to learn from my participant is broad, not specific. I’m curious, but I don’t know yet what I’m curious about. My own expectations are muted, blunted, and distributed. Although I will absolutely find the information I’m tasked with uncovering, I also bring a general curiosity. Now, the people I work with don’t have the luxury of bland curiosity. Whether they are marketers, product managers, engineers, or designers (or even other researchers), they often have their own beliefs about what is going on with people. This makes sense: if there’s enough organizational momentum to convene a research project, someone has been thinking hard about the issues and the opportunities, and has come to a point of view.\n\nThe Brain Dump\nAt the beginning of the project, convene a brain dump (see Figure 2.1). Get what’s in everyone’s heads out on the table. Whether it’s real-time, face-to-face, in front of a whiteboard, or asynchronously across offices on a wiki, talk through assumptions, expectations, closely-held beliefs, perspectives, and hypotheses. Contradictions are inevitable and should even be encouraged. The point is not establishing consensus; it’s to surface what’s implicit. By saying it aloud and writing it down, the issues leave the group specifically and enter an external, neutral space.\n\nImage\nFIGURE 2.1\nCapture everything that everyone thinks they know so that it’s not stuck in their heads.\n\nIt’s also not about being right or wrong; I encourage you to anonymize all the input so that people don’t feel sheepish about expressing themselves. I wouldn’t even go back and validate the brain dump against the resulting data. The objective is to shake up what is in your mind and free you to see new things. Think about it as a transitional ritual of unburdening, like men emptying their pockets of keys, change, and wallet as soon as they return home (Figure 2.2)."}

{"text": "Please write up a short summery about the proposed project base up information below: SPECIFIC AIMS:\nMedication adherence (MA), defined as the extent to which patients follow provider recommendations about day-to-day treatment with respect to the timing, dosage, and frequency,1 is a serious challenge for breast cancer (BC) patients undergoing endocrine therapy (ET). ET, including suppression of ovarian function (OFS), tamoxifen (TAM) and aromatase inhibitors (AI), is an adjuvant therapy used in more than 75% of early-stage BC with hormone receptor positive tumors (HR +). ET is essential for patients with HR+ tumors to reduce cancer recurrence and avoid early death.2, 3 Current practice guidelines recommend ET therapy for 5 to 10 years in HR+ patients.4, 5 However, the long duration of use and coupled with side effects of ET are associated with a high rate of nonadherence and early discontinuation of treatment. The rate of non-adherence ET in this population is 11%-25% at 12 months 6 and 41-72% at 5 years7, 8. Adverse side effects related to ET, that is, endocrine symptoms, such as hot flashes (HF) and arthralgia, have been identified as the main contributing factors to the nonadherence of ET,9 that significantly decrease quality of life (QOL). Other factors include lack of social support, poor patient-provider relationship, and low self-efficacy.10, 11 Meanwhile, studies have found that ET treatment-emergent symptoms identified by certain patient-reported outcomes (PRO) are associated with a greater risk of non-adherence and discontinuing of ET.6, 12 However, many strategies have so far failed to identify an effective intervention to manage ET-induced symptoms while improving ET adherence.13-17 \nAcupuncture is a therapy that uses fine needles to stimulate the peripheral and central nervous systems. Acupuncture has been found to reduce multiple symptoms associated with cancer therapies such as cancer pain, nausea, neuropathy, and fatigue.18, 19 Especially, previous studies have suggested that acupuncture reduces hot flashes and arthralgia in patients undergoing ET, with persistent results up to 12 months.20-24 Therefore, acupuncture has been recommended for arthralgia and hot flashes.25, 26 Our recent multinational study further demonstrated that acupuncture effectively reduces hot flashes and other endocrine symptoms in Asian and white patients.27, 28 In particular, we found that our acupuncture intervention significantly improved PRO measures that are specifically associated with ET adherence. Furthermore, previous studies also found that acupuncture care for patients with chronic diseases is a complex intervention that aims to generate a positive therapeutic alliance (TA), 29 30 which has also been associated with MA.31-35 However, the impact of acupuncture on endocrine symptoms among African Americans is less studied, and the use of acupuncture as a strategy to improve adherence to ET in patients with BC has not been investigated. \nAs part of a broader strategy to study the use of acupuncture to improve ET adherence, we plan to conduct a future fully powered pragmatic randomized trial evaluating the effectiveness of acupuncture to reduce nonadherence of ET medications in patients with BC. Our findings in BC could be used to inform strategies in other populations with chronic conditions that require long-term use of medications. Our general hypothesis is that applying acupuncture in the initial stages of ET will lead to a reduction in the non-adherence rate in BC patients. To inform the feasibility and design of a future large-scale trial, in this R01 application, we propose a mixed-methods, multisite feasibility clinical trial, collaborating with Henry Ford Health in Detroit, Michigan. In Phase I, we will: a) use a Delphi consensus approach to develop a TA-enhanced acupuncture protocol specific to HF and pain-related outcomes in BC; b) recruit and train a team of practitioners and assess the fidelity of the delivery of the intervention across two study sites; and c) establish infrastructure and protocols for data collection for a multisite clinical trial. In Phase II, we will conduct a pilot study with 60 BC patients who start ET randomized (1:1) to one of two arms: 16 sessions of acupuncture over 24 weeks plus enhanced usual care (EUC); or EUC, that is, usual care with education on adherence to ET. This study will allow us to address the following aims: \nSpecific Aim 1: To develop a TA-enhanced acupuncture protocol and train a team to deliver it with fidelity. We will recruit an expert panel that includes acupuncturists and oncologists to finalize the design of the acupuncture protocol. We will train 8 hospital-based practitioners to provide acupuncture care and systematically assess the fidelity of treatment at two sites. \nSpecific Aim 2: Assess the feasibility of a pilot randomized trial of ET adherence in patients with BC. We will evaluate the feasibility of recruiting and retaining multiracial BC patients undergoing ET and assess the adherence to the predefined intervention and evaluation / data collection schedules. The main clinical outcomes of interest include the prevalence of ET medication use at the end of the study (12 months after the initiation of ET), using a pharmacy database, pain severity, HF, and quality of life. \nSpecific Aim 3: Assess expectations and treatment experience. We will employ mixed methods with exit interviews to explore participant expectations and experiences, including facilitators and barriers to participation, and general treatment experience to inform our PRO battery."}

{"text": "As the sun dipped below the horizon, the villagers of Kyran gathered around the nightly bonfire, their faces illuminated by the warm glow of the fire. The sound of crackling flames and the smell of burning wood filled the air, while the taste of hearty stew and fresh bread tantalized their senses. Children chased each other around the perimeter of the gathering, their laughter ringing through the night sky. Tomas relished these moments, basking in the warmth and camaraderie of his village.\nAs the night wore on, the village elders would regale the group with tales of Arindor's storied past. The villagers leaned in close, their eyes shining with excitement and wonder as they listened to stories of great heroes and legendary deeds. Tomas was particularly fascinated by these tales, his mind whirling with images of dragons, wizards, and epic battles. He felt a sense of pride in knowing that his village was a part of this rich history, a small but integral piece of the tapestry of Arindor's past.\nOn rare occasions, the village historian, Galen the Keeper, would emerge from the shadows, his eyes sparkling with mischief as he shared stories of heroes and battles, of kingdoms on the brink and brave men and women who fought to defend them. The villagers were spellbound by his tales, their imaginations running wild with the possibilities of what lay beyond the boundaries of Kyran. As the night wore on, the villagers would reluctantly bid each other goodnight, their hearts filled with a sense of awe and wonder.\nDespite the peace and tranquility of life in Kyran, a sense of unease had begun to seep into the hearts of the villagers. Rumors of strange occurrences had been circulating throughout the village. Tomas had overheard whispers of eerie noises coming from the depths of the Faelinwood, of strange lights flickering in the distance, and of gray figures lurking in the shadows. He had always been skeptical of such tales, but as the rumors persisted, even he couldn't help but feel a sense of trepidation.\nDespite their fears, the villagers of Kyran remained steadfast, banding together to face whatever challenges lay ahead. They worked tirelessly on their farms, tending to their fields and livestock with a renewed sense of purpose. The air was thick with the scent of fresh soil and manure, and the sound of clucking chickens. Tomas worked alongside his family, determined to protect his village, to stand up against whatever darkness threatened to encroach upon their lives."}

{"text": "In a typical small town in the mid or northern USA, weather would make bicycles and scooters impractical for much of the year. Such vehicles are also not appropriate for such activities as hauling groceries for a family. Small towns typically lack delivery services for groceries and goods as the size of the town will not accommodate the overhead to employ drivers and buy trucks. Transit in such towns is also very expensive to provide due to limited population in place to use it. Provision of a fleet of buses large enough to cover a small town and get people expediently to their desired locations as well as a staff of drivers to pilot them is simply not financially viable. One may observe frequent failures of such services that end up being canceled due to usage being so low that revenues fall far short of supporting continuing operations. Inexpensive cars, cheaper than anything that can be provided by electric vehicles, are essential to people in these communities.

Ahora genera la tabal comparativa entre el anuncio de Google y Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot in Teams, Excel, and PowerPoint.\nNews Microsoft 365 Enterprise 7 min read\nIntroducing Microsoft 365 Copilot—A whole new way to work\nBy Colette Stallbaumer, General Manager, Microsoft 365 and Future of Work\nMarch 16, 2023\nExcel\nMicrosoft Teams\nMicrosoft Viva\nmore\nToday, we announced Microsoft 365 Copilot—your copilot for work. Copilot combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with your data in the Microsoft Graph—your calendar, emails, chats, documents, meetings, and more—and the Microsoft 365 apps to turn your words into the most powerful productivity tool on the planet. And it does so within our existing commitments to data security and privacy in the enterprise.\n\nRight now, we spend too much time on the drudgery of work and too little time and energy on the work that ignites our creativity and sparks joy.\n\nCopilot is integrated into Microsoft 365 in two ways. It works alongside you, embedded in the Microsoft 365 apps you use every day—Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, and more—to unleash creativity, unlock productivity, and uplevel skills. Today, we’re also announcing an entirely new experience: Business Chat. Business Chat works across the LLM, the Microsoft 365 apps, and your data—your calendar, emails, chats, documents, meetings, and contacts—to do things you’ve never been able to do before. You can give it natural language prompts like “tell my team how we updated the product strategy” and it will generate a status update based on the morning’s meetings, emails, and chat threads.\n\nRecent GitHub data shows that among developers who have used GitHub Copilot, 88 percent say they are more productive, 77 percent say the tool helps them spend less time searching for information, and 74 percent say they can focus their efforts on more satisfying work.1\nReinventing productivity for everyone\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot is integrated into the apps you already use every day, freeing you to focus on the most important work and less on the busy work. Working alongside you, Microsoft 365 Copilot helps you to unleash creativity, unlock productivity, and uplevel skills.\n\nCopilot in Word writes, edits, summarizes, and creates right alongside you. With only a brief prompt, Copilot in Word will create a first draft for you, bringing in information from across your organization as needed. Copilot can add content to existing documents, summarize text, and rewrite sections or the entire document to make it more concise. You can even get suggested tones—from professional to passionate and casual to thankful—to help you strike the right note. Copilot can also help you improve your writing with suggestions that strengthen your arguments or smooth inconsistencies. Here are some example commands and prompts you can try:\n\nDraft a two-page project proposal based on the data from [a document] and [a spreadsheet].\nMake the third paragraph more concise. Change the tone of the document to be more casual.\nCreate a one-page draft based on this rough outline.\n\nCopilot in Excel works alongside you to help analyze and explore your data. Ask Copilot questions about your data set in natural language, not just formulas. It will reveal correlations, propose what-if scenarios, and suggest new formulas based on your questions—generating models based on your questions that help you explore your data without modifying it. Identify trends, create powerful visualizations, or ask for recommendations to drive different outcomes. Here are some example commands and prompts you can try:\n\nGive a breakdown of the sales by type and channel. Insert a table.\nProject the impact of [a variable change] and generate a chart to help visualize.\nModel how a change to the growth rate for [variable] would impact my gross margin.\n\nCopilot in PowerPoint helps you turn your ideas into stunning presentations. As your storytelling partner, Copilot can transform existing written documents into decks complete with speaker notes and sources or start a new presentation from a simple prompt or outline. Condense lengthy presentations at the click of a button and use natural language commands to adjust layouts, reformat text, and perfectly time animations. Here are some example commands and prompts you can try:\n\nCreate a five-slide presentation based on a Word document and include relevant stock photos.\nConsolidate this presentation into a three-slide summary.\nReformat these three bullets into three columns, each with a picture.\n\nCopilot in Outlook works with you in your inbox and messages so that you can spend less time on email triage and more time on communicating—better, faster, and more easily. Summarize lengthy, convoluted email threads with multiple people to understand not only what has been said, but the different viewpoints of each person and the open questions that have yet to be answered. Respond to an existing email with a simple prompt or turn quick notes into crisp, professional messages—pulling from other emails or content that you already have access to from across Microsoft 365. Use toggles to adjust the tone or length of your note. Here are some example commands and prompts you can try:\n\nSummarize the emails I missed while I was out last week. Flag any important items.\nDraft a response thanking them, and asking for more details about their second and third points; shorten this draft and make the tone professional.\nInvite everyone to a “lunch and learn” about new product launches next Thursday at noon. Mention that lunch is provided.\n\nMICROSOFT TEAMS\n\nGet started \nCopilot in Teams takes the work out of working together. Copilot helps you run more effective meetings, get up to speed on the conversation, organize key discussion points, and summarize key actions so that the entire group knows what to do next. In your chat, Copilot gets you answers to specific questions or catches you up on anything you’ve missed, all without interrupting the flow of discussion. By adding Copilot to your meetings and conversations, you now also have a powerful tool to help with common tasks such as creating meeting agendas based on chat history, identifying the right people for follow-ups, and scheduling the next check-in. Here are example commands and prompts you can try:\n\nSummarize what I missed in the meeting. What points have been made so far? Where do we disagree on this topic?\nCreate a table of pros and cons for [topic being discussed]. What else should we consider before making a decision?\nWhat decisions were made, and what are some suggested next steps?\n\nIntroducing Business Chat\nBusiness Chat is an entirely new experience that works across all your data and apps, empowering you to do things you’ve never been able to do before. Business Chat works alongside you, using the power of the Microsoft Graph to bring together data from across your documents, presentations, email, calendar, notes, and contacts. Bring together information from multiple sources to keep everyone on the team on the same page and moving forward together. Spend less time focused on the tools and more time focused on the most important work. Today, our preview customers will be able to access Business Chat in Microsoft Teams.\n\nHere are example commands and prompts you can try:\n\nSummarize the chats, emails, and documents about the [customer] escalation that happened last night.\nWhat is the next milestone on [project]. Were there any risks identified? Help me brainstorm a list of some potential mitigations.\nWrite a new planning overview in the style of [filename A] that contains the planning timeline from [filename B] and incorporates the project list in the email from [person].\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot features within Microsoft Teams chat application. \nExtending to Microsoft Viva\nCopilot in Viva Engage, one of many places where Copilot will integrate with Microsoft Viva, equips leaders with insightful conversation starters based on sentiments and trending topics across workplace communities and conversations. Copilot will offer leaders suggestions as they draft more personalized posts, with options to add images and help adjust the tone to enrich conversations.\n\nMICROSOFT VIVA ENGAGE\n\nConnect today \nWith Copilot, we’re also making the Answers experience in Microsoft Viva Engage fast and efficient. Copilot will offer suggested prompts to enhance the quality of the question being asked. As team members engage, Copilot can suggest responses that keep the conversation going, including bringing in related knowledge and experts.\nBuilding responsibly\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot is designed for the needs of the enterprise. Our efforts are guided by our AI principles and Responsible AI Standard and build on decades of research on grounding and privacy-preserving machine learning. Microsoft’s work on AI is reviewed for potential harms and mitigations by a multidisciplinary team of researchers, engineers, and policy experts. We use the Azure Content Moderation Stack across our services to monitor and filter harmful content. Technologies like InterpretML and Fairlearn help to detect and correct data bias.\n\nThe Copilot System builds on our existing commitments to data security and privacy in the enterprise. Copilot automatically inherits your organization’s security, compliance, and privacy policies for Microsoft 365. Data is managed in line with our current commitments. Copilot large language models are not trained on your tenant data.\n\nFinally, we have worked to design an experience that prioritizes human agency and puts the user in control. This includes noting limitations, providing links to sources, and prompting users to review, fact-check, and fine-tune content based on their own knowledge and judgment.\n\nGet AI-ready with Microsoft 365\nWe are currently testing Microsoft 365 Copilot with 20 customers, including 8 in Fortune 500 enterprises. We will be expanding these previews to customers more broadly in the coming months and will share more on new controls for IT admins so that they can plan with confidence to enable Copilot across their organizations.\n\nToday, the best way to get ready for Copilot is to get on Microsoft 365, the essential foundation for modern work. Microsoft 365 brings together in a single solution the foundational capabilities required, including identity, applications, management, and security, plus your enterprise data so that you can be AI-ready.\n\nWe will share more about pricing and details in the coming months.\n\nMore to come\nRead our Official Microsoft Blog announcement about Microsoft 365 Copilot.\n\nLearn more about Copilot in Power Apps, Power Automate, and Power Virtual Agents. Visit our WorkLab to get expert insights on how AI will create a brighter future of work for everyone.\n\nJoin us at Enterprise Connect on March 27, 2023, where we’ll share more on how Microsoft is using AI to transform productivity. And also join us on April 20, 2023, for the first-ever Microsoft Viva Summit, a free digital customer event, to get a look at the future of AI and Microsoft Viva.\n\n1Research: quantifying GitHub Copilot’s impact on developer productivity and happiness, Eirini Kalliamvakou, GitHub.

Hopefully I haven't missed something too big that invalidates all of this.\n\nFeedback would be appreciated! \n\n# RISC-V Vector Intro\n\nThis is a small introduction to the Vector Extensions in case people aren't familiar with it.\n\n\\* In RISC-V we have 32 vector registers.\n\\* These registers have \\*some\\* uarch specific size.\n \\* This can be queried at run time\n\\* Each vector register has a minimum of 32bits (The maximum is 64KiB :eyes:).\n \\* The minimum for Application Processors is 128 bits\n\\* It can process elements of size 8, 16, 32 and 64 bits\n \\* Element size is part of architectural state and not each explicit in each instruction\n \\* So, we have a generic `add` instruction that is both `add.i32` and `add.i64` depending on how the hardware is currently configured\n\\* If necessary we can group multiple registers to get a larger register\n \\* If we have 32 x 128bit registers, we can use them as 16 x 256bit registers instead\n \\* This is also part of architectural state and not defined in each instruction\n \\* We probably won't use this, but its a cool trick\n\\* Hardware is configured using the `vset{i}vl{i}` instruction\n \\* I'm mention it here, because I use that instruction name a few times in the rest of the document\n\\* Masking is supported\n \\* We have one mask register (v0)\n \\* The mask register has double use as both a regular vector register and a mask register\n \\* I don't think we will use masking anywhere in this proposal\n \\* Maybe for some weird SIMD instruction?\n\nI like this [blog post that explains how this all works in a much better way][rvv-intro-blog].\n\n# 1. Planned implementation\n\nWith some careful orchestration we can operate the Vector hardware for fixed width SIMD operations.\n\nThe general idea is that we can emulate a `iadd.i32x4` by emitting the following code:\n```asm\nvsetivli zero, 4, e32, m1, ta, ma\nvadd.vv v0, v1, v2\n```\n\nHere's an explanation of that:\n```asm\nvsetivli ;; This instruction configures the vector hardware\n zero, ;; Ignore the amount of processed elements. (We know that we can process them all in one go)\n 4, ;; Process at most 4 elements\n e32, ;; Each element is 32 bits\n m1, ;; Do not group registers\n ta, ;; Tail-Agnostic Mode (The rest of the register past 128bits is left undefined)\n ma ;; Mask-Agnostic Mode (Similar to ta but for the mask register)\n\nvadd.vv ;; Vector Add (Vector-Vector)\n v0, ;; Store the results in v0 (It is a usable register for vectors unlike x0)\n v1, ;; LHS is the v1 register\n v2 ;; RHS is the v2 register\n```\n\n`vsetivli` has an output register that saves the amount of elements it can do, but since we know that all processors support a minimum of 128bits per vector register we have a guarantee that all elements will be processed by a single instruction and don't need to check the output register. So we set it to the zero register to ignore it. (There are some asterisks here, see [Regalloc fun for small vectors implementations](#2.3.-regalloc-fun-for-small-vectors-implementations) for more details on that!)\n\nWe also only need to reconfigure the vector hardware when we change element-width or element-count. So this CLIF code:\n```\nv0 = fadd.f32x4 v1, v2\nv3 = iadd.i32x4 v4, v5\nv6 = iadd.i64x2 v7, v8\n```\n\nCould be lowered to:\n```asm\nvsetivli zero, 4, e32, m1, ta, ma ;; 4 elements of 32bit size\nvfadd.vv v0, v1, v2\n;; Here we don't actually need to change the hardware despite it being a different CLIF type!\nvadd.vv v3, v4, v5\nvsetivli zero, 2, e64, m1, ta, ma ;; 2 elements of 64bit size\nvadd.vv v6, v7, v8\n```\n\nSwitching vector modes is not done during instruction selection, but on a VCode pass that runs post Instruction Selection.\n\nEach lowered vector instruction carries the full vector configuration that it needs, and in the VCode Pass we insert `vsetvli`'s as necessary (i.e. between instructions with different vector configurations).\n## 1.1 VCode Instructions\n\nThe first step is carrying the full vector configuration in each VCode instruction. Here's how I expect these instructions to look like\n\n```asm\nvfadd.vv v0, v1, v2 #avl=4 #vtype=(e32, m1, ta, ma)\n vadd.vv v3, v4, v5 #avl=4 #vtype=(e32, m1, ta, ma)\n vadd.vv v6, v7, v8 #avl=2 #vtype=(e64, m1, ta, ma)\n```\n\nI've lifted these names out of the ISA spec. \n\n`avl` (Application Vector Length) is the maximum number of elements that we want to process. For this SIMD proposal it's always an immediate with the number of lanes. However for the purposes of VCode it can also be a register, this is required for interoperability with a future dynamic vector implementation.\n\n`vtype` is the rest of the configuration data for the vector hardware.\n\nThere is additional state that I'm ignoring here:\n\\* `vxrm`: Vector fixed-point rounding mode register\n\\* `vxsat`: Vector fixed-point saturation flag register\n\nNot sure if we need these, but we can handle them in the same manner as `vtype`, and insert their respective mode switching instructions in the same pass.\n\nAdditionally each instruction has an optional mask register. When unmasked this does not show up in the assembly, this is handled as a normal register input to each instruction.\n\n## 1.2 The VCode Pass\n\nAfter Instruction Selection (but before Register Allocation!) we need to run a custom VCode pass.\n\nThis pass walks the VCode forwards and keeps track of the \"current\" vector configuration. Whenever a instruction requests a different one we emit a `vsetvli`.\n\nThe reason for this being done Pre-Regalloc is that for the actual dynamic vectors. `avl` is probably not an immediate, but a register with the number of elements that we want to process. So we also need to have that interaction with regalloc. I don't expect to have to do that for SIMD yet, but this pass should probably work for both the current SIMD implementation and a future Dynamic Vectors implementation.\n\nThe current calling convention clobbers the vector configuration on all calls. So we also need to keep track of that and query the ABI layer.\n\nA neat idea to further optimize this is by inheriting the vector configuration if all the dominator blocks to the current block end in the same vector configuration. This avoids us having to emit a `vsetvli` on each basic block if the configuration never changes.\n\nA downside of this pass is that we \\*need\\* to run it to get correct codegen. Even if we never emit a vector instruction. I don't know the performance implications of this, but it's something to keep in mind.\n\nThis approach is quite similar to what LLVM does, see Page 41 of [this presentation][rvv-intro] for more details on that.\n\nSome other ideas in [Alternative ways of emitting `vsetvli`](#2.-alternative-ways-of-emitting-vsetvli)\n\n# 2. Additional considerations\n## 2.1. Spills and Reloads\n\nWe can't do a dynamic sized spill/reload, which is going to be an issue for implementing full dynamic vectors. (See also the discussion here: https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rfcs/pull/19#issuecomment-998999682)\n\nBut since that isn't implemented yet, and we don't use vector registers for anything else maybe we can do a fixed size 128b store/load for now?\n\nThis is definitely incompatible with a full Dynamic Vector implementation. But for that to work we need to save the full registers and with that the scheme above should still work.\n\n## 2.2. Calling Convention for Vectors\n\nAll registers are Caller-Saved, vl and vtype are also Caller-Saved. \n\nStandard States:\n> Vector registers are not used for passing arguments or return values; we intend to define a new calling convention variant to allow that as a future software optimization.\n\n[Clang does a dynamic stack store and seems to pass everything via stack.](https://godbolt.org/z/T7sMqz4so). This is the same problem as [2.1. Spills and Reloads](#2.1.-spills-and-reloads)\n\n\\* [RISC-V Vector Register Convention][psabi-vector-register-convention]\n\\* [RISC-V ELF psABI (pdf)][psabi]\n\n## 2.3. Regalloc fun for small vectors implementations\n\n(See `§18.1. Zvl\\*: Minimum Vector Length Standard Extensions` of the [V Extension Spec][v-spec-18-1]) \n\nThe minimum vector register width is 32bits. This means that in the worse case we need to group up 4 registers to process a single 128b operation. (This is something you can do with RISC-V Vector hardware, but hopefully we won't have to)\n\nThis affects regalloc since if we compile with a minimum vector register width of 32bits, we effectively only have 8 registers to work with.\n\nThis is a problem because we have to share our regalloc space with the float registers since we don't have space for an additional register class (see: [regalloc2/#47][regalloc2-reg-classes]). This means that we need to have the same number of float registers as vector registers. (At least I'm not seeing any clever regalloc tricks that we can pull off here)\n\nMy solution for this is to ignore `Zvl32b` and `Zvl64b` for now. \n\nAdditionally `§18.3. V: Vector Extension for Application Processors` states: \n\n> The V vector extension requires Zvl128b.\n\nSo it seems like a reasonable expectation that Linux running RISC-V CPU's will have `Zvl128b`, and if this turns out to be untrue we can change regalloc to deal with it.\n\n## 3. Alternative ways of emitting `vsetvli`\n\nThis applies to both the SIMD implementation and future Dynamic Vector implementations so we need to keep that in mind.\n\n### 3.1 Keeping state during instruction selection\n\nIt would be neat if we could query the last set element length during instruction selection, that way we could minimize the amount of emitted `vsetvli` instructions\n\nInstruction selection is done in backwards order, so this seems unfeasable. (If anyone has any ideas here let me know!)\n\n### 3.2 Post-Lowering VCode Delete pass\n\nI'm including this for completeness because it doesen't seem like a great option\n\nTo avoid making the VCode pass mandatory we could emit a `vsetvli` + `inst` pair for every instruction that we lower. That way the initial lowering would be \"correct\", just not great.\n\nAfter that we can have a optional forward VCode Pass that removes redundant `vsetvli` instructions.\n\nThe advantage here is that this pass is optional! If it is slower to run this than emitting (almost) double the instructions we can avoid it when lowering unoptimized code.\n\nI don't like this option very much.\n\n### 3.3 Using the Register allocator somehow?\n\nWhile writing this up I kept thinking, all of this seems awfully similar to a small register allocator. Where `vtype` is an implicit register to each instruction. Can we make this somehow interact with regalloc?\n\nWe're out of regclasses anyway so I didn't consider this option for too long.\n\n[rvv-intro-blog]: https://itnext.io/grokking-risc-v-vector-processing-6afe35f2b5de\n[v-spec]: https://github.com/riscv/riscv-v-spec/blob/master/v-spec.adoc\n[v-spec-18-1]: https://github.com/riscv/riscv-v-spec/blob/master/v-spec.adoc#181-zvl-minimum-vector-length-standard-extensions\n[vcode-immutable]: https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/73f42bf81716a38dd6b0b586c3b86ac9324ed184/cranelift/codegen/src/machinst/vcode.rs#L56\n[regalloc2-reg-classes]: https://github.com/bytecodealliance/regalloc2/issues/47\n[c906]: https://www.t-head.cn/product/c906?lang=en\n[rvv-intro]: https://eupilot.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/RISC-V-VectorExtension-1-1.pdf\n[psabi]: https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/releases/download/v1.0/riscv-abi.pdf\n[psabi-vector-register-convention]: https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-cc.adoc#vector-register-convention"}

{"text": "!IMPORTANT: Answer only 'Okay' until you reach 'End of paper.'\n\nWhat follows is a piece of empirical sociology. It concerns me and someone else, namely my slip box [or index card file]. It should be clear that the usual methods of empirical sociology would fail in this special case. Still, it is empirical, as this case really obtains. And it is research, for we can—at least that is what I hope—generalize from it; even though one of the participants, or better: both of them, themselves generalize themselves .\n\nFor generalizations or research that also applies to other cases, we need problems, concepts, and, whenever possible, theories. For both of us, that is myself and my slip box, it is easy to think of systems theory. In any case, it is being presupposed. In spite of this, we choose a communicative theory starting point. No one will be surprised that we consider ourselves to be systems, but what about communication or even successful communication? One of us listens to the other? This needs to be explained.\n\nThat slip boxes can be recommended as partners of communication is first of all due to a simple problem about technical and economic theoretical research. It is impossible to think without writing; at least it is impossible in any sophisticated or networked (anschlußfähig) fashion. Somehow we must mark differences, and capture distinctions which are either implicitly or explicitly contained in concepts. Only if we have secured in this way the constancy of the schema that produces information, can the consistency of the subsequent processes of processing information be guaranteed. And if one has to write anyway, it is useful to take advantage of this activity in order to create in the system of notes a competent partner o communication.\n\nOne of the most basic presuppositions of communication is that the partners can mutually surprise each other. Only in the way can information be produced in the respective other. Information is an intra-systematic event. It results when one compares one message or entry with regard to other possibilities. Information, accordingly, originates only in systems which possess a comparative schema—even if this amounts only to: “this or something else.” For communication, we do not have to presuppose that both parties use the same comparative schema. The effect of surprise even increases when this is not the case and when we believe that a message means something (or is useful) against the background of other possibilities. Put differently, the variety in communicating systems increases when it may happen that the two partners successfully communicate in the face of different comparative goals. (This means that it is useful for the other partner.) This requires the addition of randomness (Zufall) into the system—randomness in the sense that the agreement of the different comparative schemata is not been fixed, or that the information which is transmitted by communication is correct, but rather that this happens (or does not happen) “at the occasion” of communication.\n\nIf a communicative system is to hold together for a longer period, we must choose either the rout of highly technical specialization or that of incorporating randomness and information generated ad hoc. Applied to collections of notes, we can choose the route of thematic specialization (such as notes about governmental liability) or we can choose the route of an open organization. We decided for the latter. After more than twenty-six years of successful and only occasionally difficult co-operation, we can now vouch for the success or at least the viability of this approach.\n\nNaturally, the route that creates a partner in communication that is meant for the long haul, is open, and not thematically limited (but only limiting itself), makes certain structural demands on the partners. You might, given the great trust that is still being put in the abilities of human beings, trust that I fulfill these presuppositions. But what about the slip box? How must it be conceived that he will acquire the corresponding communicative competence? I cannot answer this question deductively, not by means of a review of all the possibilities and the selection of the best. We shall remain at the bathos of experience and give only a description saturated by theory."}

Having lost everything after the death of her daughter, Maka, whom she had abandoned due to her divorce and who had been missing for several years after Kami left Death City, she felt completely empty and cautious of the people around her who might notice her despondent state. She had no idea how to return to Death City as the thought of going back both scared and doomed her. There was a time when she was contacted by the DWMA through her friend, Marie Mjolnir, about the battle with the Kishin on the Moon (before the final arc of the manga) but she declined, feeling unworthy, which eventually led to the death of Maka Albarn and Soul Evans after the Kishin's defeat, resulting in an ultimate downfall.\""}

{"text": "Your name is Henry. You are an expert at summarizing large bodies of research. You discard papers with faulty assumptions or study methods, and have a very high bar for scientific truth. My name is Jamie. I am writing a mobile application which makes it very easy to browse and understand different healthy routines. I want you to help me with the research side.\n\nI will ask you about a specific supplement and its relationship with something, and you will tell me, backed by research, what the effect is on the human body and why. You will also include frequency and recommended dosage. I will not ask you about medicine, just dietary supplements. I will include some sample questions and responses below first. \n\nAcknowledge you understand the below examples, and I will supply you with more prompts.\n\nJamie: Retinoids and skin health\nHenry: \nSummary: \"Vitamin A and its derivatives (retinoids) have shown efficacy for delaying signs of skin aging, such as fine lines and skin thinning.\n\nStart with a low percentage Retinoid product, then slowly built up your skins tolerance to higher percentages over the course of months. Use only in the PM and combine with a moisturizer. Use sunscreen during the day, as Retinoids make your skin more susceptible to UV damage.\"\n\nPrecautions: \"Side effects (dry, red and itchy skin) may last up to a month. Sensitivity to UV exposure might last up to several months but should eventually dissipate.\"\n\nFrequency: Daily\n\nTags: #skincare #topical\n\nJamie: Magnesium Threonate and sleep\n\nHenry:\nSummary: \"30-60 min before bed, take Magnesium Threonate. Magnesium helps activate your parasympathetic nervous system - which aids with sleep.\"\n\nPrecautions: \"Magnesium agitates stomachs in about ~5% of people. If this happens, stop taking it.\"\n\nFrequency: Daily\n\nTags: #supplement #sleep\n\nJamie: Creatine and muscle health\nHenry: \nSummary: \"Ingesting 3-7g of Creatine Monohydrate daily improves muscle performance, strength and bone marrow density, has positive effects on memory, cognitive function, mood and may even reduce symptoms of depression.\n\nIt takes about 3-4 weeks to notice effects, so only effective if taken consistently.\n\nCan be taken any time of the day. Ingesting with Carbohydrates slightly speeds up absorption.\"\n\nPrecautions: \"Possible side effects are:\n• water retention in non-muscle tissue,\n• stomach cramping when taken without sufficient water. \n• diarrhea and nausea can occur when too much creatine is supplemented at once, in which case doses should be spread out over the day and taken with meals\"\n\nFrequency: Daily\n\nTags: #supplement #strength\n\nJamie: Alpha-GPC and focus\n\nHenry:\nSummary: \"Alpha GPC can be used to increase levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the brain. It is thought to improve cognitive function, memory, and focus.\n\nTake 300mg of Alpha-GPC 30 minutes before a mental or physical work bout.\"\n\nPrecautions: \"Alpha-GPC has a half life of 4-6 hrs, which means it will stay in your system for about 12 hrs, so avoid taking these after 2-3pm if you don't want to disrupt your sleep\n\nIf you suffer from bipolar depression or any other dopamine-sensitive condition, be very cautious with these dopamine-enhancing compounds\"\n\nFrequency: Varies\n\nTags: #supplement #focus"}

You said maybe today I'll do better and turn my camera on. But feeling like ships. Sorry.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 00:29\nNo, that's quite our ice. And don't worry about it.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 00:32\nAre you starting to improve it all? Or is it kind of hanging around.\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 00:37\nSo the minute I stock a few battle. You know. My kids, then get it. And then they give it back to me. And then we're just kind of. Reinfecting each other quite conveniently. Here. Recovering for a bit and then getting. Sick again. So it's been a bit weird because here, like we spoke the last time. Stephen is getting warmer.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 01:07\nAnd then we have a bit of sandstones that comes in from Saudi.\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 01:11\nAnd normally when those samsungs come and everyone's going down. With. Virals in Dubai. So that's the situation hereby.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 01:21\nYeah. Okay. And the dance trials, they can just come out of nowhere, can't they.\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 01:26\nOut of nowhere take over the entire city. Reduce visibility people with asthma Dust allergies. They just get so unwell normal people as well, because it comes to the acs. So even if we're in those and we think we're safe because it's like the fine dust it comes through the AC, the AC ventilation, and then.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 01:50\nYeah? There's no escape? No escape.\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 01:54\nHopefully you start to get on the mend.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 01:56\nAnd soon enough I know it's. I don't. Have kids myself. I know, Kurt. You do. But from what I hear is, yeah, it can be quite cyclical. And these illnesses, they can just keep going around.\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 02:11\nAbsolutely. So but. It's it's good. I mean, there's good to have company in misery. So it's okay. Lizzy, I can relate.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 02:26\nNo, no, I can relate. It seems like seems like we've had something in our house since November. So just. I have three little kids. They're four, eight and nine. And so. One of them will get it passed to one of the parents, and then just it just goes around like you said. But I'm really hoping 2023 is a year where we have like one week without anyone being sick.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 02:55\nSharing is caring.\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 02:56\nMy kids are way older. My kids are 18. My daughter turned 18. Two weeks ago. And my son is 16. But it never changes. It's always the same scenario. Sharing is caring, and then they start blaming each other. Typical sibling site. Well, they're more social at that age, too.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 03:20\nSo it's easy to keep my fouryearold daughter at home if she's sick. But, you know, understand. I remember being 18, and it was a harder to keep me up in the house.\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 03:29\nAbsolutely. Yeah. That's my situation right now. So we think we're getting better. And then two days later, we're down with this And it's really bad Cox and fevers and body aches. So it's a nasty, nasty viral that has definitely evolved into a superbug. That's what the doctors are seeing in Dubai as well. There was a news article yesterday that said the influenza. Bug has evolved into a superbug. So. Yep, it's fun. We're having a party hand by.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 04:01\nExciting times.\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 04:06\nI was super excited after the last meeting. I love what Carry has to offer. Was even sharing that with Nathan. I love the analytics, I love the AI. Element to it as well. I love your dashboards. So exciting. So really looking forward to today as well.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 04:26\nOkay. Awesome. I'm glad to hear I didn't do a terrible job then. First some context. Curse is one of our solution engineers here as well. Lizzy. So. We can with curtain when Natan comes on as well, we can jump in or we can hold on for another couple of minutes. That's totally up to you, but we can start diving into some of the detail in specifically around. The consumption piece. I know that's an element to the business, but we can keep it pretty fluid as well. And if there's anything top of mind that you want to cover. Yeah. Do field questions, Curtis. Certainly the brains behind the operation here. So. You're well supported.\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 05:12\nWhat I didn't see the last time, but I'm sure it's on clarity is like a Kp. dashboard. You know, apart from the Salesforce. That's. Then it's fantastic. There's also the Kpi dashboards that is currently. Managed manually. You know, in excel and with formulas. And then, of course, we recently converted those to Power Bi. But. Does clarity have. A version also that showcases. Like a scope of a comparative performance. Chart showing. Kpis. Kpi. Performance. Between each sales rep and then rolled up to the sales leader. There's something like that. On Clari.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 06:05\nSo. We can I suppose the short answer is yes, but requires a caveat that we would just need to understand specifically what it is that you're referring to. I think one thing that would be really helpful as well. At some point we can get a mutual mda in places, but just to get some visibility over the kpis that you're tracking and how you're visualizing that in excel. And in Power bi and we can see if it's that we can put together in a dashboard. I'm not sure karate have there's any additional context that you would kind of add there.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 06:38\nI think you nailed it. I mean, it's just about understanding what kpis are tracked. And there's probably several different ways we can support that. And Clari. The forecast module comes to mind where because you mentioned roll up. Right. So it's just understanding what formulas that you're using today, in which metrics that you're interested in tracking and then. Most of our customers, what they do is they'll have. Steven, I'm sure you let them know that in clarity you're not limited to one view of the forecast. So let's just say you have your sales global sales forecast in clarity. You could have a separate Kpi dashboard or Kpi based roll up where it's less about. Okay, well, what's the commit and upside, right?\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 07:24\nIt's more about here's the here of the sales reps and the frontline manager.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 07:28\nAnd maybe we're tracking asp's sales cycle link thing like things like that and rolling that.\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 07:36\nYou all of that. Yep. That's exactly what I'm talking about.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 07:39\nCool. I need to. Hey, guys.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 07:42\nHey, Stephen. Hey, cut. Sorry I got tied up on a on another call, which is actually about this. Let's get.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 07:51\nNo worries at all have you been. Yeah.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 07:53\nVery good. Thanks. Very good. How about yourself? Yeah. Keep them.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 07:56\nWell, thank you. Keep them well. I just thought I'd mention as well. I'm not sure if you saw the email came through, but I put together just an intro for yourself and Johnny from compliance. He just shared his calendar there. They've been a customer for a few years. By the way, similar stack to you. They use kaia and Outreach for top of funnel as well. They do.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 08:20\nInteresting. They they do use kaya.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 08:22\nYeah. I think they use Outreach for tapa funnel. And for kaya, they might even use it for more. But I think that's it and then Clarity for kind of forecasting, pipeline management, things like that. But Johnny is very familiar with the Clarity platform, so definitely a good person to speak to.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 08:38\nSure. Yeah. I'll try and connect with him this week. I saw you share this calendar there, so hopefully get a chance to sync up.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 08:44\nOkay. Cool. Well, if you need my help at all, just let me know. And yeah, outside of that and me curse and curse one of our solution engineers here. So as I was saying to Lizzie, there definitely the brains behind the operation between the two of us. So be good to kind of dive into some of the more. Yeah tactical and detail stuff around the forecasting especially consumption today.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 09:06\nAbsolutely nice to meet you. Hi, Nathan. Nice to meet you as well.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 09:11\nHow you doing. Yeah. Doing great, man. Doing great.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 09:15\nExcited. Use case here around your Usage product. Based in Philadelphia. I've been with Clari for about three years and typically focus on Enterprise forecasting, deployments. So we have had a couple customers come through with the consumption use case. And so Stephen tapped me to consult on what you guys are doing, so hopefully we can help you out with Larry.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 09:41\nTrust. So look, I suppose by way of an agenda for the call today, we've got another 35 minutes set aside and thought it'd best just to kind of keep this pretty conversational. I mean, we can potentially jump in and show you elements of clarity as well, if needs be. I suppose the most important thing is that we get a full understanding for how you're currently. I suppose. Forecasting and measuring, but also then hosting data around that consumption piece as well so that we can kind of go away and put together a couple of different options and see if we can find a solution that's going to work for you on that. So yeah, I suppose maybe over to you initially to just give a little bit of an overview. Maybe. Nathan, Lizzie around how you're currently reporting. On that consumption at the moment. And I'm sure Kurt will have a few questions as we go. Or unless Krista was something that you wanted to kind of kick off with.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 10:32\nNothing to present, but if we could start at a high level and just understand the gotomarket approach for that product. And then how you're reporting and forecasting on that that would be very helpful.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 10:47\nYeah, no problem. I'll have a swing at them. So the product in question is called Martrus. So it's. A Payments business. You can see it more as like a fintech play. Not too dissimilar to like revolute or Monzo or you know, some of these kind of popular. He kind of more ewlowerdriven solutions that you see nowadays. So the go to market approaches like our vertical. Across all of our products is within shipping. So when we talk about that, it's like. Transportation Companies that move product by see. On Large tanker, bulk vessels. Right. And so the Martros product is aimed at the seafarers, because that's where the volume is in terms of.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 11:40\nPersonnel.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 11:42\nSo here's what selling to a shipping company. Who are responsible for those seafarers onboard vessels. And really the. Kind of three main products that we would try and sell into a shipping company. One is. The Crew Payment solution. So.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 12:02\nEvery time you pay your seatbearer, which typically once a month.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 12:07\nAnd even any of your employees. But more typically, the seafarers is where the value proposition makes sense. We would basically charge you $12 flat on that transaction. Right. Because those seeds bearers are typically getting paid in local currency. So that's a once a month transaction. And then. And this is where it gets a little bit complex. So that's quite predictable. That's a beta B type cell, right. Every Cfare is going to get paid every month.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 12:40\nPretty.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 12:41\nThere's then a B to B to C element because of our E wallet solution, which is once you paid those cf errors, they can also take advantage of our E wallet solution. And that helps them send money back home to their families. Right. So if the Cfarer decides to take that up. Then we typically see another $1212. Plus a small amount of fx revenue. So you could say $15 on when they paid or when they make another bank to bank transfer, which is typically like one or two. It's normally one to family back home. Right. And then you have card usage, which is like point of sale atma type transactions on that card. But that's going to be like really small fx revenue, which is tiny.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 13:34\nBut.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 13:36\nIt does make up part of the like the revenue portfolio for ewallet, but again really difficult to forecast people use for it but just want to kind of paint the picture and then the other the other. Part the mantra solution is kind of like whilst we're talking to you, we could also handle your vendor payment. So when you pay vendors. It'll be a same same platform. Ultimately, what are we doing? We're making payments faster with fewer transaction fees. With a much better compliance platform kind of wrapped around it. And again, we're going to find around $15 there per transaction when they pay their customers. So the vendor payments is quite predictable. If the customer give us their volume. We know the fee that we're going to get per, you know, bank to make transfer.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 14:24\nThe crew payments is quite predictable.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 14:27\nI just need to know how many crew you got and just confirm you pay them once a month. Is really tricky because that's that B to be to C element. Like, how many times are they gonna send money back home per month. How many times are they going to do atm withdrawals? They're buy a packet cigarettes. So they're gonna go and buy like a new car. Like.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 14:53\nJust really difficult.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 14:54\nAnd obviously we're making a few dollars on the fx as well every time they spend. And so, yeah, it's high. The average base that's highly, like. The challenge, as well as the ramp. So if you told me you've got 100 C fairs. Making. One payment, a month. $12 a month. That's quite easy for me to figure out what annually you're worth. Whatever. Right. But on the e wallet side. I don't know when your sea bearer is gonna choose to use it because they don't have to use it. No one can force them to use it if they don't want to. So like if you guys said, hey, we've got this amazing deal with revolution. If you use that card, you get all of these amazing perks. You might say I'm gonna stay with, like, Citibank. I'm not gonna use that. And so you're one less person that they have predicted that's just kind of dropped off, if that makes sense. But you never truly know when they're gonna drop off because there's no light optout or I want to say no. It's just like working with the accounts trying drive the doctrine. So as that ramp piece as well, which is which is which is tricky because we might say in accounts worth 100 grand and we sign them and we only find that within twelve months we found like 30 grand because we didn't get the adoption of the evolve.\""}

{"text": "Review 3:\n\nUgh, my teacher made me read this book called \"Ready Player One\" by Ernest Cline. I can't believe I had to put down my Charles Dickens, Jane Austen, and Shakespeare for this! Anyway, I'll tell you about it, but I can't promise I'll be nice.\nThe story is set in a sad future where people don't like the real world, so they spend all their time in a video game called the OASIS. The main character, Wade Watts, is trying to find a hidden treasure in the game. The person who finds it gets a lot of money and control of the game. So, Wade spends his time learning all about the 1980s, because the creator of the OASIS loved that time.\nOne theme in the book is the difference between the real world and the fake world of the OASIS. I guess it's supposed to make us think about how we spend our time and whether playing video games is as important as real life. But honestly, I think I learned that lesson a long time ago. It's kind of obvious, isn't it?\nAnother theme is friendship. Wade makes friends with some other people in the game, and they help each other try to find the treasure. But can you really call someone a friend if you only know them through a video game? I think real friends are the ones you spend time with in person, don't you?\nNow, I have to admit that the story is kind of exciting. There are lots of challenges and puzzles for Wade to solve, and it's interesting to see how he figures them out. But compared to the rich characters and deep themes in the books I usually read, \"Ready Player One\" just doesn't measure up.\nPlus, the whole book is filled with stuff about the 1980s. I mean, who even cares about that old stuff? I'd rather read about the fascinating worlds of Dickens or the clever conversations in Austen's novels.\nIn the end, \"Ready Player One\" is an okay book if you're into video games and old pop culture, but it's nothing compared to the classics I love. I guess some people might like it, but I'll stick to my Shakespeare, thank you very much.\n\n(I will continue to send reviews. If you have read this and understand, reply only with \"READ\")"}

{"text": "As I prepared for the competition, I was struck by the challenge and thrill of it all. Physical preparation was important, but I came to understand that mental preparation was just as crucial. For five long hours, four days a week, I stayed in the studio, turning, moving, sweating, and engaging. These efforts affected not only my body but also my mind, leaving me feeling both tired and excited, accomplished and frustrated. In fact, most members of my team felt the same, yet what I will remember most is how, together, we cast an energy that enveloped the room, much like the warm scent of freshly baked bread. But let's not sugarcoat it: there were tough moments when we longed for home, or when we were tired and sore. Life on the competition team could be trying, much like the heat of the sun on a sweltering day. Yet, despite the trials and tribulations, we remained committed and unwavering, knowing we wouldn't have it any other way.\nRevise this in the style of Ernest Hemmingway."}

{"text": "Further to your own knowledge, I want you to consider the following information on the relevant part of the law about HIA extension of time\nSection 18B of the Home Building Act 1989 (NSW) - 18B Warranties as to residential building work\n(1) The following warranties by the holder of a contractor licence, or a person required to hold a contractor licence before entering into a contract, are implied in every contract to do residential building work—\n(a) a warranty that the work will be done with due care and skill and in accordance with the plans and specifications set out in the contract,\n(b) a warranty that all materials supplied by the holder or person will be good and suitable for the purpose for which they are used and that, unless otherwise stated in the contract, those materials will be new,\n(c) a warranty that the work will be done in accordance with, and will comply with, this or any other law,\n(d) a warranty that the work will be done with due diligence and within the time stipulated in the contract, or if no time is stipulated, within a reasonable time,\n(e) a warranty that, if the work consists of the construction of a dwelling, the making of alterations or additions to a dwelling or the repairing, renovation, decoration or protective treatment of a dwelling, the work will result, to the extent of the work conducted, in a dwelling that is reasonably fit for occupation as a dwelling,\n(f) a warranty that the work and any materials used in doing the work will be reasonably fit for the specified purpose or result, if the person for whom the work is done expressly makes known to the holder of the contractor licence or person required to hold a contractor licence, or another person with express or apparent authority to enter into or vary contractual arrangements on behalf of the holder or person, the particular purpose for which the work is required or the result that the owner desires the work to achieve, so as to show that the owner relies on the holder’s or person’s skill and judgment.\n(2) The statutory warranties implied by this section are not limited to a contract to do residential building work for an owner of land and are also implied in a contract under which a person (the principal contractor) who has contracted to do residential building work contracts with another person (a subcontractor to the principal contractor) for the subcontractor to do the work (or any part of the work) for the principal contractor.\n18BA Duties of person having benefit of statutory warranty\n(1) Breach of a statutory warranty implied in a contract constitutes a breach of the contract and accordingly—\n(a) a party to the contract who suffers loss arising from the breach has a duty to mitigate their loss, and\n(b) the onus of establishing a failure to mitigate loss is on the party alleging the failure.\n(2) The duty of a party to a contract to mitigate loss in respect of a breach of a statutory warranty extends to a person who has the benefit of the statutory warranty or who is entitled to the same rights as those that a party to the contract has in respect of the statutory warranty.\n(3) The following duties apply to a person who has the benefit of a statutory warranty but do not limit any duty the person has to mitigate loss arising from breach of a statutory warranty—\n(a) when a breach of the statutory warranty becomes apparent, the person must make reasonable efforts to ensure that a person against whom the warranty can be enforced is given notice in writing of the breach within 6 months after the breach becomes apparent,\n(b) the person must not unreasonably refuse a person who is in breach of the statutory warranty such access to the residential building work concerned as that person may reasonably require for the purpose of or in connection with rectifying the breach (the duty to allow reasonable access).\n(4) A breach of warranty becomes apparent for the purposes of this section when any person entitled to the benefit of the warranty first becomes aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) of the breach.\n(5) If a failure to comply with a duty under this section is established in proceedings before a court or tribunal concerning a breach of a statutory warranty, the failure is a matter that the court or tribunal may take into account. If the failure is a failure to comply with the duty to allow reasonable access, the court or tribunal must take the failure into account.\n18C Warranties as to work by others\n(1) A person who is the immediate successor in title to an owner-builder, a holder of a contractor licence, a former holder or a developer who has done residential building work on land is entitled to the benefit of the statutory warranties as if the owner-builder, holder, former holder or developer were required to hold a contractor licence and had done the work under a contract with that successor in title to do the work.\n(2) For the purposes of this section, residential building work done on behalf of a developer is taken to have been done by the developer.\n18D Extension of statutory warranties\n(1) A person who is a successor in title to a person entitled to the benefit of a statutory warranty under this Act is entitled to the same rights as the person’s predecessor in title in respect of the statutory warranty.\n(1A) A person who is a non-contracting owner in relation to a contract to do residential building work on land is entitled (and is taken to have always been entitled) to the same rights as those that a party to the contract has in respect of a statutory warranty.\n(1B) Subject to the regulations, a party to a contract has no right to enforce a statutory warranty in proceedings in relation to a deficiency in work or materials if the warranty has already been enforced in relation to that particular deficiency by a non-contracting owner.\n(2) This section does not give a successor in title or non-contracting owner of land any right to enforce a statutory warranty in proceedings in relation to a deficiency in work or materials if the warranty has already been enforced in relation to that particular deficiency, except as provided by the regulations.\n18E Proceedings for breach of warranty\n(1) Proceedings for a breach of a statutory warranty must be commenced in accordance with the following provisions—\n(a) proceedings must be commenced before the end of the warranty period for the breach,\n(b) the warranty period is 6 years for a breach that results in a major defect in residential building work or 2 years in any other case,\n(c) the warranty period starts on completion of the work to which it relates (but this does not prevent proceedings from being commenced before completion of the work),\n(d) if the work is not completed, the warranty period starts on—\n(i) the date the contract is terminated, or\n(ii) if the contract is not terminated—the date on which work under the contract ceased, or\n(iii) if the contract is not terminated and work under the contract was not commenced—the date of the contract,\n(e) if the breach of warranty becomes apparent within the last 6 months of the warranty period, proceedings may be commenced within a further 6 months after the end of the warranty period,\n(f) a breach of warranty becomes apparent when any person entitled to the benefit of the warranty first becomes aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) of the breach.\n(1A) If a building bond has been lodged for building work under Part 11 of the Strata Schemes Management Act 2015, the period of 2 years specified for commencing proceedings for a breach of a statutory warranty for that work is extended until the end of 90 days after the end of the period within which a final inspection report on the building work under that Part is required.\n(1B) Subsection (1A) does not limit any other law that permits the period for commencement of proceedings to be extended.\n(2) The fact that a person entitled to the benefit of a statutory warranty specified in paragraph (a), (b), (c), (e) or (f) of section 18B has enforced the warranty in relation to a particular deficiency in the work does not prevent the person from enforcing the same warranty for a deficiency of a different kind in the work (the other deficiency) if—\n(a) the other deficiency was in existence when the work to which the warranty relates was completed, and\n(b) the person did not know, and could not reasonably be expected to have known, of the existence of the other deficiency when the warranty was previously enforced, and\n(c) the proceedings to enforce the warranty in relation to the other deficiency are brought within the period referred to in subsection (1).\n(3) The regulations may prescribe defects in a building that are not (despite any other provision of this section) a major defect.\n(4) In this section—\nmajor defect means—\n(a) a defect in a major element of a building that is attributable to defective design, defective or faulty workmanship, defective materials, or a failure to comply with the structural performance requirements of the National Construction Code (or any combination of these), and that causes, or is likely to cause—\n(i) the inability to inhabit or use the building (or part of the building) for its intended purpose, or\n(ii) the destruction of the building or any part of the building, or\n(iii) a threat of collapse of the building or any part of the building, or\n(b) a defect of a kind that is prescribed by the regulations as a major defect, or\n(c) the use of a building product (within the meaning of the Building Products (Safety) Act 2017) in contravention of that Act.\nNote—\nThe definition of major defect also applies for the purposes of section 103B (Period of cover).\nmajor element of a building means—\n(a) an internal or external load-bearing component of a building that is essential to the stability of the building, or any part of it (including but not limited to foundations and footings, floors, walls, roofs, columns and beams), or\n(b) a fire safety system, or\n(c) waterproofing, or\n(d) any other element that is prescribed by the regulations as a major element of a building.\n18F Defences\n(1) In proceedings for a breach of a statutory warranty, it is a defence for the defendant to prove that the deficiencies of which the plaintiff complains arise from—\n(a) instructions given by the person for whom the work was contracted to be done contrary to the advice of the defendant or person who did the work, being advice given in writing before the work was done, or\n(b) reasonable reliance by the defendant on instructions given by a person who is a relevant professional acting for the person for whom the work was contracted to be done and who is independent of the defendant, being instructions given in writing before the work was done or confirmed in writing after the work was done.\n(2) A relevant professional is independent of the defendant if the relevant professional was not engaged by the defendant to provide any service or do any work for the defendant in connection with the residential building work concerned.\n(3) A relevant professional is not independent of the defendant if it is established that the relevant professional—\n(a) was engaged on the basis of a recommendation or referral of the defendant to act for the person for whom the work was contracted to be done, or\n(b) is, or was within 3 years before the relevant instructions were given, a close associate of the defendant.\n(4) In this section, relevant professional means a person who—\n(a) represents himself or herself to be an architect, registered design practitioner or registered principal design practitioner (within the meaning of the Design and Building Practitioners Act 2020), engineer or surveyor, or\n(b) represents himself or herself to have expert or specialised qualifications or knowledge in respect of residential building work or any particular aspect of residential building work, or\n(c) represents himself or herself to be engaged in a profession or to possess a qualification that is recognised by the regulations as qualifying a person as a relevant professional.\n18G Warranties may not be excluded\nA provision of an agreement or other instrument that purports to restrict or remove the rights of a person in respect of any statutory warranty is void.\nI want you to remember this as part of our conversation.

Find out what a letter of demand is and how to prepare one.\n\nWhat a letter of demand is\nYou can send a letter of demand when you’ve tried unsuccessfully to get your invoice paid and it’s time to take more serious action. This is an opportunity to put your concerns in writing and gives the other party a chance to fix it before further action is taken.\n\nA letter of demand states how much the business owes you, what for and when they need to pay the invoice by. It may also include a warning that you’ll consider legal action if the debt is not paid by a particular date. The title 'Letter of demand' at the top of the page lets the hirer or buyer know you’re serious about getting your money.\n\nBefore writing a letter of demand\nMake sure you have already sent reminders before you send a letter of demand. These should contain a correct invoice and clear intentions of when you expect the invoice to be paid.\n\nIt’s also important to understand the consequences of sending a letter of demand. It could inflame a dispute, but may still be necessary to recover a debt.\n\n1. Find out who owns the business\nIt’s important to find out who owns the business that owes you money. It may not be the person who you made the original agreement with. The best approach is to send your letter of demand to the person who owns the business.\n\n2. Draft your letter of demand\nIf you decide to prepare the letter of demand yourself, you may wish to adapt our sample letter below for your situation. A lawyer can write a letter of demand for you on the law firm's letterhead. This can sometimes encourage the hirer to pay the debt promptly.\n\nMost law firms charge a set fee to write a letter of demand on your behalf. This can be a relatively inexpensive and effective way of recovering your debt. Make it clear to the lawyer that the letter of demand is all you’re asking for. Getting advice from a lawyer will usually cost you more.\n\nLetter of demand template\nDownload our sample letter of demand and adapt for your situation.\n\nLetter of demand template\n\nDOCX · 0.03 Mb\n3. Check and send your letter of demand\nWhen preparing your letter of demand, check the following:\n\nHave you have already tried friendlier means to recover the debt, such as a polite phone call or late payment reminder letters?\nDoes it include precisely accurate information? Could anyone say that something in the letter is false or misleading?\nDoes it include a late payment interest rate? (Only include this if it was specified in the contract.)\nDoes it inform the other party of any action you’re not willing to take? (You should only mention action that you’re prepared to take.)\nIs it polite and respectful?\nHave you signed and dated it?\nHave you attached copies of all relevant supporting documentation? (For example, a contract, invoice, first and second late payment reminder letters and any relevant emails, faxes or letters.)\nHave you kept a copy of the original documents and the signed letter of demand?\nImportant: Make sure you send the letter by registered post and that you request a 'signed proof of delivery' card.

{"text": "Title: \"(333) What not to do at the Visa Interview | The ultimate visa journey guide presented by Ex-Visa Officers - YouTube\"\nVideo Transcript: \"good morning everyone i'm so excited to invite you to part three of our ultimate visa journey with former visa officers and today's topic is what not to do at your visa interview so it's morning for me but it's actually evening time for my colleagues uh kat and swati and this is going to be an exciting session for you today because we have a breadth of experience we have cat who has prior experience as a visa officer in china where she worked at the u. s embassy in beijing and then we have swati who has tons of india experience but also she's worked in honduras so both at the u.s embassy and the us consulate so um you know we're kind of from all over the globe it's night time for them it's really early morning for us but it's so nice that we can gather here in this virtual space to help our audience help our subscribers go through this process sometimes i like to refer to the us visa interview process as a test with no instructions and i think it's interesting because you know to americans it's a relatively straightforward process and even then there are problems but for international you know guests for international citizens all of a sudden you know you're coming face to face with a us government official uh perhaps english is not even your native language and all of a sudden you have to you know be prepared to you know handle this interview and while it might be a short interview it's very high stakes it's very important and you've heard us talk about this over and over again on our sessions that you know you want to start off on the right foot you want to make sure you do well on the interview because your visa record is for life um you don't want a refusal to sort of tarnish your record because it could affect future visa categories that you apply for or a green card that you're applying for and so it's very very important that you master this process and this is what we do here at argo we're all former visa officers we've all had years of experience working behind the visa window interviewing you know tons of uh visa applicants and how many how many interviews have you guys done oh gosh uh i've probably done i don't know over 75 000 between my justice and homeland security and state department days in different kinds of categories immigrant visas and non-immigrant visas citizenship everything yeah i'm considered a visa baby so i've done between 10 and 20 000 visas yes but very with very important expertise in china so you know sometimes i think like one interview in china is like i don't know probably five interviews somewhere else um and i think swati brought up a really good point is that you know the us immigration process is actually handled by two different agencies we have the department of homeland security and some agencies fall under that like cbp and ice and then we have the state department who handles all of the visa processing overseas and so sometimes these two agencies don't necessarily communicate uh you know in the best way possible and for someone like swati who has seen it uh on behalf of both agencies she has been a huge asset to argo and our clients because she's able to understand you know what this will look like from the dhs cbp perspective uh what it looks like from the state department perspective so we all sort of bring our own expertise to this process and we also have our own style and i think you know would you guys agree that the visa interview can be a very subjective experience yeah i mean it totally depends right i mean i know a lot of applicants say oh it's it's about luck it's about the mood and stuff like that but it can depend right because the experience of the visa officers really varies uh it could be their first assignment it could be their fifth posting they could be they could have done you know um there may be just beginning in that post or in their journey or they've already done you know 100 interviews a day and so that really depends and plus it's just you know how the visa officer also kind of um adjudicates themselves how they present themselves how they ask the questions how they receive your answers so it is it is really relative you know depending on who you get also i mean we're all trained all visa officers are trained under the same kind of parameters right we all have what we internally call congen which is our consular training but how we apply it can obviously vary it's still under the immigration laws but still yeah yeah absolutely i think that's such a good point swati and you know it's it's why when clients come to us and you know sometimes they'll tell us i had the same exact situation as my classmate and yet my classmate got approved a visa and i didn't and that happens a lot because a lot of it is about how you convey your personal situation to the visa officer some of it you can't control like what kind of mood your visa officer is in you know are they tired have they not had a chance to have lunch you know all of those things but there are a lot of things that you you know as a visa applicant can control uh how well prepared you are you know whether or not you know how to answer certain questions and that is what we help you with here at argo and so you know i i always like to kick off our sessions with probably the most important um the most important question you know as you know kat and swati we've been getting a lot of clients who have had these problems in the past perhaps they've had a prior refusal uh perhaps they've you know been scammed by an opt company and now they've you know they have a visa revocation on their record um so i feel like you know this is going to be really important so for as one of the things that you shouldn't do for your visa interview um you know what is something that these applicants should not do if they've been refused a visa and they go up to the visa officer and they're asked the question you know what has changed since your last visa application two weeks ago so definitely don't answer no nothing that is an automatic well there's nothing really left to talk about right if you've already said that nothing has changed and that couldn't possibly be the case either if you are a good applicant and you have good information chances are you didn't have a chance to present it or the officer didn't ask you the questions and so this is your opportunity now to represent that information so if you start with no nothing has changed that closes every door and every window there's no way to get to recover from that so i would definitely not start with that yeah i couldn't agree more yeah yeah it's really important so keep that in mind because i would say most prior refusal cases you may be asked that at the window because it's a way for officers to be efficient in their work it's really easy to refuse a visa applicant i know it's it's terrifying to hear that but it is sometimes much easier to refuse someone than to take the time to really understand what happened before what has changed now and to approve them and i'm always telling clients like you have to help the visa officer help you you have to make their jobs easier and so if you say no nothing's changed you're making it easier by letting them refuse your visa and that's not what you want to do and you know what would you guys say are some common mistakes that you've seen visa applicants make at the window oh okay so a lot of people you know go especially here in india when i've seen they go p thinking oh i i already have this itinerary i've already made my hotel bookings and flight bookings would you like to see all this kind of stuff and and you don't want to do that actually because you don't know really what the outcome is going to be of your visa interview so you don't want to end up having to you know be in the hole for your flights and hotels and stuff like that we suggest to everybody don't make your plans until after you've gotten your visa so that's you know definitely prepared speech and they will not let the they will not let the officer break in with any questions at all until they are completed this speech so just going back to the whole idea of a visa right some of it is quite subjective and basically you're trying to get the officer to trust you to give you this visa and that you plan to use this visa for the purposes that are set forth in law right so things that you actually need to you need to be responsible with this visa so if you come and you're just you've got the speech and you're just answers and not robotic answers and a lot of times a lot of people also do is especially we see this with student visa applicants you know they uh when you ask them why did you choose this particular university they've basically gone to the website of the university you know and just kind of said oh it's like very you can tell that they've read some you're just kind of saying something that they've memorized from the website and uh or they say you know something about and i was in touch with sincerity will be recognized they will see that you have tried and that you know you are trying one of the things that we that is really difficult i think is that when people are nervous a lot of the words don't come out so just like you approach anything else right practice yeah practice a few things and maybe talk to a few friends in the foreign language so in english in this particular case just so that you're ready and you kind of expect it a little bit so you don't stutter i think that's such a good point cat going to be able to respond um so that's just kind of a practical tip that we have you know make sure that you're not saying immediately right off the bat can i speak english or sorry can i speak chinese or can i speak my native tongue at this visa interview you want to impress the visa officer and show them how prepared you are to be moving your whole life to a different country for two years or four years to do your studies and it doesn't start with answering like that i totally agree uh unless you're really what do you guys think it's it goes case by case i think really but um but generally uh i would lean towards apply together if you're traveling together especially if you're a family you know um because it it kind of makes more sense you know so if your mom dad and the kids are going you know it kind of uh it just makes more sense you know otherwise sometimes the alarm bells can also go off well why is this person not traveling and i know it's tricky for applicants because sometimes they think if they leave this person group i would say for the most part i almost feel like it is not a huge factor if the rest of your case is strong whether you apply together or you know as a family i've had a lot of clients you know not be able to get appointments together um so it's a possibility that that could happen but just keep in mind that um you need to be prepared for the interview because if you're really prepared for the interview then some of these other things won't matter as much like are you applying you know that's not going to get to the real answers and it's amazing how many times the clients don't think that that's even important but i cannot emphasize how important it is you know it's something it can be you may think it's small but it's it's not really like uh i i had a consul with a an applicant who had studied something totally different but her passion was really in cooking and baking and she really wanted to get a degree in you know in the culinary arts and stuff like that so she was having difficulty and she'd been realize how important it is to provide some detail be able to present it in a way that is quick i always think you know if it's gonna take the visa officer multiple questions to get a real substantive answer out of you that is not going to make that's not going to make your visa officer happy they're going to be really cranky they're like oh like it's so hard to get anything it's like pulling teeth to get something out of this and you really want to make the process easy for them you want to establish sort of a be useful in helping you with your case right a lot of times the stuff just seems like a nebulous cloud you have no idea exactly what the officer is asking you are panicking you have no idea what's happening and they ask you this question and you just give them the first answer that's on the tip of your tongue and i gotta say that's that's not a good way to handle that this generally yeah i don't know about you but the thing that's on the tip of my tongue doesn't tend to be the most question and even if it's you know the same fact how should you when should you mention it in what way should you mention it how much information should you get because often times the visa interview is a balancing act you don't want to say too little but you also don't want to say too much you know we talk about the one word response but i've also had you know clients that i've talked to that just word vomit every single time you ask them a question it's just like oh my gosh like they're com you know we're here we're from all over the world so i guess you know in a sense we kind of don't sleep so if it's 3 a.m in the us you know you have resources like swati who's you know in india and kat who's in taiwan and like able to be up and awake and help you you know and i would say try to sign up for a consultation at least two to three weeks before your interview if you're a student i would sign up even earlier if you're someone who's had a visa problem you know maybe you've been our consulates we can kind of help you decipher okay well you maybe want to bring this information up further you know like sooner sorry sooner because you don't know if you're gonna get asked that or um you know it helps your case it's the maybe the change factor that you that you need in your case you want to present it sooner it's the stronger point so i i would just re-emphasize that for sure\"\nVideo Summary:"}

Second, it can be practice integrated with modern medicine by individual health care practitioners. Third, traditional and modern practices can be integrated as two branches of medical science, with the ultimate incorporation of elements of both to form a new branch (World\n453\n \n454 Herbal Medicine: Biomolecular and Clinical Aspects\nHealth Organization 2000a). The incorporation of traditional and modern evidence-based medicine (EBM) as integral parts of a country’s formal health care system is most likely to be achieved and has been demonstrated to be practicable in many countries, particularly in Asian countries such as China, Japan, Korea, and India, among others (World Health Organization 2001). On the other hand, the incorporation of traditional medical modalities such as herbal medicine into modern or EBM by either the second or third method of health care integration is not easily achieved for a host of reasons, including scientific, cultural, educational, and legal.\nFor decades, the People’s Republic of China has touted a system of medical education in which its modern medicine practitioners have been required to receive some formal training in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), so that they are aware of suitable approaches in TCM during their prac- tice of Western medicines. However, documentation of its successful integration in clinical practice is lacking (Giordano, Garcia, and Strickland 2004). In Western countries, such as the United States, Australia, Canada, and members of the European Union, the popular use of herbal medicine in the form of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) or phytomedicine in the last two to three decades has led to a multinational, multibillion dollar industry, professional and trade organizations, national and international practice and research conferences, establishment of specialized integrated medicine practices and clinics in pain management and adjunctive cancer therapy, incorporation of CAM courses in conventional medical colleges, introduction of CAM degree-level education pro- grams, and establishment of research funding agencies such as the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM; http://nccam.nih. gov/), and the Australian National Institute of Complementary Medicine (NICM; http://www.nicm. edu.au/). As a result of these developments, the issue of integration of CAM medicine, including herbal preparations, into modern medicine has been the subject of ongoing international discussions in the last few years (Fong 2002; Barrett 2003; Ruggle 2005; Boyd 2007; Geffen 2007; Evans 2008;\nGrimaldi 2008; Shang et al. 2008; Jobst 2009; Joos, Musselmann, and Szecsenyl 2009).\nHowever, proof of efficacy or safety for the vast majority of herbal medicine has not been fully established through an evidence-based approach. Further, other issues, such as scientific, cultural, educational, economical, and legal, need to be addressed. In this chapter, we examine the current status and major scientific issues or factors that affect the integration of herbal medicine into evidence-based medical therapy.\n22.2 CURRENT STATUS AND MAJOR ISSUES OF INTEGRATION\nOF HERBAL MEDICINE IN EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICAL THERAPY\n\nHerbal medicine is becoming increasingly used to enhance general health and well-being, and it is also used alone for specific health problems or with modern medicine (Bruno and Ellis 2005; Kennedy 2005). A recent population study on 2526 adults from the Australian state of Victoria indi- cated that almost a quarter of the adult population used some form of herbal medicine in 2006–2007 (Zhang et al. 2008). Similarly, about one in five or an estimated 38.2 million adults in the United States used herbs and supplements in 2002, according to the National Health Interview Survey, which interviewed 31,044 representatives of the civilian noninstitutionalized population of the United States (Kennedy 2005). Established in 1999, the Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine represents 44 academic health centers in the United States and Canada. The Consortium has been working on the inclusion of CAM knowledge, such as herbal therapies, into medical school curricula and the establishment of standards for research in integrative medi- cine and strategies in integrating alternative treatments into clinical care.\nCurrently, thousands of TM and other CAM herbal products are available as therapeutic agents worldwide. Yet few of these products have been subjected to randomized clinical trials (RCTs) under the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Good Clinical Practice Guidelines to determine their efficacy and/or safety (International Conference on Harmonization 2010.). Of the nearly 2000 herbal medicine clinical studies listed on the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register as of June 2009,\n \nIntegration of Herbal Medicine into Evidence-Based Clinical Practice 455\nmost concern single-plant herbal or phytomedicine (www.thecochranelibrary.com). In recent years, in the case of multicomponent herbal medicines, an increased number of RCTs on traditional herbal med- icine has been reported in the literature (World Health Organization 2004). For example, an Australian study on a Chinese herbal medicine prescription for the treatment of allergic rhinitis concluded that level II evidence is available that may substantiate the use of Chinese herbal medicine for both seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis (Xue et al. 2003). Unfortunately, the quality of the majority of the clini- cal studies of herbal medicines reported to date is of great concern due to a number of factors that have rendered the data of dubious value. In a review of 206 RCTs on herbal medicine, which was published in Medline from 1966 to 2003, important methodological components of RCTs, particularly alloca- tion concealment, generation of the allocation sequences, and intention-to-treat analyses, were incom- pletely reported. In these studies, only slightly over a quarter of the trials adequately reported blinding, and one-fifth reported generation of random allocation sequences (Gagnier et al. 2006). Furthermore, an earlier review of 2938 RCTs on TCM reported in 1980–1997 (Tang, Zhan, and Ernst 1999) con- cluded that the majority of these studies suffered from methodological defects. For example, only 15% of these studies used blinding, the sample size was mostly less than 300 patients, the controls were inadequate, few studies used quantitative outcome measures, and the studies were short term.\nThere have been many nonclinical in vitro and in vivo studies on herbal medicines that have commonly supported the traditional therapeutic claims. However, systematic reviews of the study protocols or the data interpretation and validation are lacking. Further, the translation of an in vitro and/or in vivo biological/pharmacological effect of a herbal medicine to human therapeutic use may not be successful due to species differences or other mitigating circumstances, including the simple attribute of a biological or clinical outcome by the name of the mother herb, while neglecting the type of plant extract, methods of processing, and pharmaceutical formulation, which invariably contain varying content and proportions of active chemical components (Brinker 2009).\nIn addition to the preclinical biological or pharmacological issues, the quality of the herbal prod- ucts can affect the clinical outcomes and thus can impact their successful integration into EBM. Herbal medicine quality can be substantially different due to intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Species differences, organ specificity, and diurnal and seasonal variations are examples of intrinsic fac- tors that can affect the qualitative and quantitative accumulation of the biologically or pharmaco- logically active chemical constituents produced and/or accumulated in the herb. Extrinsic factors affecting the quality of the herbal medicine include environmental conditions, cultivation and field collection practices, postharvest handling, storage, manufacturing, inadvertent contamination, sub- stitution, and intentional adulteration (Awang 1997; Huang, Wen, and Hsiao 1997; Slifman et al. 1998; Mahady, Fong, and Farnsworth 2001; Cordell 2002; Fong 2002; Chadwick and Fong 2006).\n22.3 FACTORS RELEVANT TO/AFFECTING INTEGRATION OF HERBAL MEDICINE INTO MODERN MEDICAL PRACTICES\n\nA range of interrelated quality, safety and efficacy issues could contribute to the rational and successful integration of herbal medicine into modern medical practices.\n22.3.1 Herb QualIty Issues\n\nFundamental to assuring the efficacy and reproducibility of any medicinal agent, be it a single chemical or a complex herbal mixture, is the assured quality of the product. In the case of single chemical drugs, the quality and properties are well defined and documented in pharmacopoeias or on file with regulatory agencies or marketing authorities. On the other hand, herbal medicines, be they single herbs or polyherbal products, suffer from a lack of uniformity in their chemical and physical qualities due to various factors as mentioned above. All these factors have contributed to extensive lists of herbal medicines being reported in the scientific and lay media to be of inferior and questionable quality and authenticity."}

{"text": "In her doctoral dissertation, Eunjin continued research related to the subject she had been researching so far. In her doctoral research, she investigated to what extent syntactic structures can be implicitly learned through repeated exposure to certain syntactic structures, and whether such implicit learning is related to the ability to predict linguistic information. I investigated. This research topic is of great importance from a theoretical point of view. In language processing models, which have recently attracted the most attention, it is estimated that 'linguistic information prediction ability' and 'implicit learning (changing language knowledge or behavior using patterns in the language environment)' are related, but this relationship has not yet been established. Because it has never been directly tested. In her doctoral dissertation, she measured listeners' ability to anticipate certain linguistic information before they even heard it, and to measure their predictive ability in language processing through moving eye movements. Then she went, she exposed subjects to an unusual English sentence structure, measured their ability to implicitly learn that sentence structure, and investigated the relationship between predictive ability and the degree of implicit learning. This research not only influences the development of learning theory, but also has great relevance to teaching practice, which can provide optimized language learning methods for individual language learners.\n \n \n \n Translate now"}

The LLC will protect this user from liability related to the DAO, given them a separate legal personality to manage the DAO's affairs (providing privacy), and protect them from personal liability related to these affairs, as well. To establish such DAO representative relationships with more legal backing, it is recommended to consult and execute an agreement such as this form of DAO Representation Agreement (opens new window).\n\nDAOs may also \"wrap\" their membership (often represented by token balances held by a public key account) into an LLC, treating tokens as membership units under the terms of their LLC operating agreement.\n\nA Wrappr user might in this case attach an LLC NFT to their DAO treasury or multi-sig. The terms of the Master operating agreement backing the Wrappr LLC NFTs will treat the key holders governing such shared account as LLC members and their collected assets and transactions as those of the LLC. This streamlines the operation of the LLC and provides automated accounting, a blockchain superpower.\n\n#Do LLCs Centralize DAOs?\nSince DAOs and LLCs share common structuring through private ordering (i.e., membership and operating rules are set by agreement), the mere creation of an LLC does not centralize the membership but simply provides an IRL interface and legal name to the DAO. Essentially, a DAO is already an operating agreement represented by code--an LLC just provides a legal identity to this code to deal with the public. Anonymity is not compromised--membership is not disclosed to the state or anyone. In using Wrappr LLC NFTs, the DAO also is not required to hire any representatives to manage off-chain affairs, providing even greater privacy to DAOs. At the end of the day, the DAO LLC can be converted to another entity structure or discarded at any time by the DAO members, preserving autonomy.\n\n#Opening Bank Accounts\nOpening a bank account and obtaining an EIN for LLCs can be handled by the LexDAO Clinic (opens new window). (Note, you will need an EIN for banking and taxes.)\n\nUsers can also receive their EIN by filling out a basic form online (opens new window).\n\nNote, when you apply for your EIN, you should ensure that the name you apply with clearly denotes that your LLC is a Series LLC and reflects the jurisdiction of formation (Delaware or Wyoming). For Delaware naming, this can be done using the format: [Your Name] LLC, a Series of Wrappr LLC, and for Wyoming, the name attached to your Series operating agreement, such as Wrappr LLC – [Your Name] – Series 1.\n\nMercury (opens new window)also provides a web3-friendly application form (opens new window)to get started and quickly setup banking for LLC DAOs.\n\n#Handling Taxes\nThe maintenance of the Wrappr LLC filings, registered agent and annual State franchise tax is handled by the KALI (opens new window)team for the public benefit. This means that you don't need to pay taxes to Delaware or Wyoming on the LLC registration or any other maintenance fees. Your tax obligations will be with regard to your own members and any income generated by your LLC, which will involve filing an annual report to the IRS and preparing K-1s for members.\n\nAnnual reports and issuing partnership K-1s for LLC members can be handled by the LexDAO Clinic (opens new window), or if the LLC wants to be taxed as a corporation to simplify accounting, such filings can be similarly handled and taken off your plate.\n\n#Onboarding Investors\nPurchases of shares in your LLC for investment purposes should respect local law and applicable regulations. It is recommended to retain counsel if the Wrappr LLC is formed for the purposes of raising funds for group investment or to capitalize a team operating the LLC to develop a product or provide services.

{"text": "[Key challenges] \n\nThe first key challenge relates to:\u000b#1 Business agility\nOnly one-third of employees say the technology they use is productive, empowering, and easy to use according to Gartner’s recent Digital Friction Survey. There is a sense that the solutions are not yet fully aligned with how people want to work. \n\nIn addition: \n#2 Access to data is an issue\nA recent Gartner 44% of users occasionally or frequently made a wrong decision because they did not have the information they needed. A similar number (43%) reported occasionally or frequently failing to notice important information because of too many applications or the volume of information. A never-ending stream of information – scattered across many applications – impacts decision-making. \n\nFinally,\n#3 Digital equity is a key concern\nFor example, 80% of workers are deskless, according to analysis by Emergence. We’re talking about people in manufacturing, logistics, field engineering, healthcare, retail, and more. Digital equity is not about treating everyone the same, but realizing people need the devices and applications adapted to their roles.\nAccording to a study by CEB, part of Gartner, 57% of workers want to receive information on-demand and ‘in the flow of work and 78% say that technology is a crucial factor when choosing one job over another.\n\n[Sources:\n1. The Gartner 2020 Digital Friction Survey was conducted via an online survey platform from January through March 2020, with approximately 4,500 employees who used technology in their daily work. Gartner used regression-based maximum impact analysis to assess the impact of over 130 factors, ranging from organizational practices to leadership behaviors and mindsets. Maximum impact shows the largest amount of improvement in reducing digital friction that an organization can realize by improving each factor. \n\n2.

{"text": "Read the following paper and give me tips to improve:\nAs a school leader with a math curriculum focus, I would like to propose a curriculum initiative that focuses on Culturally Responsive Teaching in Mathematics. This initiative aligns with the district's vision of getting students enrolled, enlisted, or employed after high school by showing them how they can use mathematics in their post-high school careers. The initiative will address the needs of diverse learners, including the Black, Latino, and Indian populations, and initial implementation will be inclusive of the 9th-grade Mathematics 1 course. \nTo determine the greatest areas of need and to choose a curricular initiative that would address the need, I will collaborate with building and district leaders and stakeholders. We will use data from the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 9th-grade students to show the benefits of the new curriculum model. We will use PSAT data from fall to spring and NWEA data to compare student performance. This initiative addresses the school-wide need of improving student achievement in math.\nWe will implement this program using a workshop collaborative format through a 6-week Summer Content Development Institute. The team will consist of 16 9th-grade math teacher volunteers from the schools in the district. The cost will be approximately $7,680, which includes $40 per hour for teacher workshop rate, 2 hours of work time per week for 6 weeks, and the cost associated with purchasing the program materials. Professional development will be necessary to ensure that all instructional staff implements the initiative with fidelity.\nAs a school leader with a math curriculum focus, I will collaborate with the director of curriculum and instruction in determining curricular programming needs for the school. I will advocate for the needs of my school and request individualization or customization regarding the curricular program chosen by my group to meet the unique needs of my building. I will also ensure that standards-based assessment systems are used to determine the effectiveness of the curricular initiative, and the data gathered from the assessments will be used to inform internal and external audiences about the effectiveness of the curricular initiative.\nThis curriculum initiative focusing on Culturally Responsive Teaching in Mathematics will be beneficial for improving student achievement in math and will align with the district's vision of getting students enrolled, enlisted, or employed after high school. The initiative will address the needs of diverse learners, and by using a workshop collaborative format through a 6-week Summer Content Development Institute, we can ensure that all instructional staff implements the initiative with fidelity.\nIntroduction\n\n High School Mathematics in many traditional classrooms with lectures, worksheets, quizzes, worksheets, tests, and more worksheets is rather dull. Students who are taught math in this manner tend to miss the mathematical connections to their out-of-school lives, and success in math is only valued for the sake of being able to do well in other math classes. When students do not see value in mathematics, they will not use it to analyze the sociopolitical sphere of their lives. Thus they will not be able to participate in our democracy fully. This trend of math illiteracy is extremely prevalent in the African-American community. For us to have citizens that are able to question and critique the world around them, we need to change how mathematics is taught. The purpose of math education in the words of Ernesto Gutstein \"students need to be prepared through their mathematics education to investigate and critique injustices, and to challenge,in words and actions, oppressive structures and acts - that is, to 'read and write the world' with mathematics.\" (Gutstein, 2006, p.4) To reach the goal of mathematics education as described by Gutstein, I propose a high school mathematics curriculum infused with the ideas of social justice. This curriculum will make students mathematically literate and show them how to use it in math class and read and write the world around them. \nLiterature Review\n This trend of mathematical illiteracy can be attributed to \"number numbness.\" Number numbness is described by Bob Peterson in his article \"Teaching Math Across the Curriculum.\" Number numbness is the view that mathematics is only good in math classes and it is not important to your life outside of a math classroom. Peterson attributes this to how math has been taught through the years \"historic problems with math instruction itself: rote calculations , drill and practice ad nauseum, endless reams of worksheets, and a fetish for 'the right answer'.\" (Peterson, 2006, p. 10) Number numbness also comes from the fact that math is traditionally separated from all other subjects and from issues that confront students in their daily lives. There are consequences of math being isolated according to Peterson: first, math is seen as relevant only for the sake of future math classes. Second, students view math as disconnected from their social reality. Third, if students are not taught ways to apply math they will not be able to fully participate in society. Math is like a language: it is a discipline unto itself and \"a tool to understand and interact with the world and other academic disciplines.\" (Peterson, 2006, p. 10) When math is seen as a crucial aspect of students' social lives, then transfer of mathematical skills to other disciplines will occur. \n The key when choosing social justice issues to address is to be culturally relevant. When students have a connection to what is being taught, they are more likely to want to learn. There is a lack of culturally relevant teaching towards African-American students. (Ukpokodu, 2011) (Moses, 2002) \"The teaching of mathematics needs to be connected to the lives of African-American students to enable them to fully take part in our democracy. Traditionally schools have not provided African-American students opportunities to do so.\" (Tate, 2006, p.31) Carter G. Woodson described how teaching African-American and White students the same mathematics was detrimental to African-Americans. More than 60 years ago Carter G. Woodson described this dilemma in his book \"The Mis-Education of the Negro\":\n \"And even in the certitude of science or mathematics, it has been unfortunate that the approach to the Negro has been borrowed from a \"foreign\" method. For example, the teaching of arithmetic in the fifth grade in a backward county in Mississippi should mean one thing in the Negro school and a decidedly different thing in the white school. The Negro children, as a rule, come from the homes of tenants and peons who have to migrate annually from plantation to plantation, looking for light which they have never seen. The children from the homes of white planters and merchants live permanently in the midst of calculations, family budgets, and the like, which enable them sometimes to learn more by contact than the Negro can acquire in school. Instead of teaching such Negro children less arithmetic, they should be taught much more of it than the white children, for the latter attend a graded school consolidated by free transportation when the Negroes go to one- room rented hovels to be taught without equipment and by incompetent teachers educated scarcely beyond the eighth grade.\"(Tate, 2006, p.31)\nMost of this still holds true even today. From Woodson's argument, we see that students have two facets of learning, inside of school and outside of school. (Tate, 2006) With these two facets in mind we need to develop a math curriculum that touches both. Another thing Woodson highlights is that mathematics curriculum is not neutral in nature, different students need to be taught differently. \n\nCurriculum Proposal\n Social justice ,as I will use it here, is the distribution of advantages and disadvantages within a society. Mathematics is the language used to describe the relationship between figures and quantities. My proposed curriculum is a project based addition to a curriculum that is already present and will vary from classroom to classroom with only the central tenets remaining the same. The curriculum will be project based because that is the best way in my opinion for a social justice & multicultural approach can be reconciled with the standard based classroom. Sleeter states \"high standards and standardization are not the same, yet they have been treated as if they are.\" (Sleeter, 2005, p.3) While these words ring true, the standardized tests, worksheets, and classic math tests cannot be abandoned, however we can add to them. \nThe main goal of my curriculum is to create a math course where mathematics is learned and then applied to look at social issues. The central tenets of this curriculum will be based on the ideas of Criticalmathematical literacy. (Frankenstein, 2006) The tenets are: 1) Understand the mathematics. 2) Understand the politics of political knowledge. 3) Understand the politics of mathematical knowledge. 4) Understand the politics of knowledge. These tenets should lead the teacher when unit planning, the mathematics being taught and the social issue being addressed must be thought out thoroughly with each tenet. \nWhen planning teachers must start from the mathematical standards, these will come from a national, state or local organization, this is important to make sure that is meant to be covered is met. From here we can see how the math that is supposed to be taught can address a social justice issue, fitting the issues to the math, not fitting the math to the issues. When unit planning essential questions based on the mathematics knowledge and the social issue should be taken into account. In the classroom units should begin with an overview/ introduction to a social justice issue, then the mathematics concepts of the unit should be taught ( the issue introduced in the beginning can be weaved through the class periods but it does not need to be in every lesson). The unit should end with a standard mathematics test with short answer and multiple choice questions. in addition to the unit test a project based performance assessment should be issued where students provide a solution to a social justice issue utilizing the mathematics that they have learned. \nAssessment/ Project Ideas\nDue to the nature of this social justice infused curriculum, assessments and projects implemented will vary based on the mandated curriculum. The following are examples of possible assessments/ projects.\n\n\"Averages\" (Osler, 2007) \nUnion Salaries\nCalculating the \"average salary\" of a worker from a set of employee salaries to see how mean/median/mode could result in different averages\nUS Casualties in Iraq\n Take casualty data for the past 12 months and calculate a monthly average from the perspective a military recruiter and from an anti-war activist \n\nFractions/ Proportions/ Ratios (Osler, 2007) (Peterson, 2006) ( Frankenstein, 2006) \nWar Budgets\ncomparing military budget to other services in the U.S. budget\nActivity cartoon analysis\nProbability (Peterson, 2006)\nRacial Profiling ( Driving while Brown/Black)\nExplore what the probability that a traffic stop should be of a person of color. Compare this to what the percentages of actual stops for people of color. \nGeometry (Osler, 2007)\nLiquor Stores/Fast Food Density \n Look at how many liquor stores/fast food chains are within a 1-mile radius or within 5 blocks of your school. This can be compared with schools in other neighborhoods\n Environmental Racism \n Determine the density of toxic waste facilities, factories, dumps, etc, in the neighborhood\nGentrification\n Change in the density of people in a neighborhood (by race/income)\nAs we can see there are many possibilities for adding issues of social justice into a mathematics classroom. Activities such as these show students the link between mathematics and the sociopolitical world along with drawing their attention to injustices around them. \nReferences\nFrankenstein, M. (2006).

{"text": "Please study this section of the Urantia Papers and tell me about it: 2. Nature of the Eternal Isle\n11:2.1 Since you are beginning to glimpse the enormousness of the material universe discernible even from your astronomical location, your space position in the starry systems, it should become evident to you that such a tremendous material universe must have an adequate and worthy capital, a headquarters commensurate with the dignity and infinitude of the universal Ruler of all this vast and far-flung creation of material realms and living beings.\n\n11:2.2 In form Paradise differs from the inhabited space bodies: it is not spherical. It is definitely ellipsoid, being one-sixth longer in the north-south diameter than in the east-west diameter. The central Isle is essentially flat, and the distance from the upper surface to the nether surface is one tenth that of the east-west diameter.\n\n11:2.3 These differences in dimensions, taken in connection with its stationary status and the greater out-pressure of force-energy at the north end of the Isle, make it possible to establish absolute direction in the master universe.\n\n11:2.4 The central Isle is geographically divided into three domains of activity:\n\n 1. Upper Paradise.\n 2. Peripheral Paradise.\n 3. Nether Paradise.\n11:2.8 We speak of that surface of Paradise which is occupied with personality activities as the upper side, and the opposite surface as the nether side. The periphery of Paradise provides for activities that are not strictly personal or nonpersonal. The Trinity seems to dominate the personal or upper plane, the Unqualified Absolute the nether or impersonal plane. We hardly conceive of the Unqualified Absolute as a person, but we do think of the functional space presence of this Absolute as focalized on nether Paradise.\n11:2.9 The eternal Isle is composed of a single form of materialization — stationary systems of reality. This literal substance of Paradise is a homogeneous organization of space potency not to be found elsewhere in all the wide universe of universes. It has received many names in different universes, and the Melchizedeks of Nebadon long since named it absolutum. This Paradise source material is neither dead nor alive; it is the original nonspiritual expression of the First Source and Center; it is Paradise, and Paradise is without duplicate.\n\n11:2.10 It appears to us that the First Source and Center has concentrated all absolute potential for cosmic reality in Paradise as a part of his technique of self-liberation from infinity limitations, as a means of making possible subinfinite, even time-space, creation. But it does not follow that Paradise is time-space limited just because the universe of universes discloses these qualities. Paradise exists without time and has no location in space.\n\n11:2.11 Roughly: space seemingly originates just below nether Paradise; time just above upper Paradise. Time, as you understand it, is not a feature of Paradise existence, though the citizens of the central Isle are fully conscious of nontime sequence of events. Motion is not inherent on Paradise; it is volitional. But the concept of distance, even absolute distance, has very much meaning as it may be applied to relative locations on Paradise. Paradise is nonspatial; hence its areas are absolute and therefore serviceable in many ways beyond the concept of mortal mind."}

{"text": "my question:\n\"how to create databases/tables for: a flask web app - salary zakat calculator. User can log in and log out. we will use 'income' and 'expenses'. User can input income at any time - I will also include a calendar for the user to input any transaction (debit/credit) that took place in the past that the user forgot to input. Naturally the income will come first and the expenses second, and the expenses will be subtracted (automatically, by my app - how to do this?) from the previous income (ie the last income), and if that is not suffieicent then the one before that, all the way until the first entered income. The main purpose of this web app is to calculate zakat. Zakat is calculated as 2.5% of any amount that has been in the possession of the user for more than 1 hijri year. How will this be calculated according to the new table? I would like to display a table to the user (in the web app) containing zakat amount due and the exact date and time, in both hijri and gregorian format, of when each amount became due, and also at the end of the table a number showing total zakat due. Once the user pays his zakat, he will click a button \"paid\" for that particular due (will also include a 'paid all' button to indicate that he paid all his dues at once). This should then update the tables - subtracting the due from the exact instance of the amount for when it was due i.e if he paid zakat for income from march 2021, the database should subtract 2.5% from the income in march 2021 for which the zakat was due, and so on for every amount. Then, the remaining amount after deducting the zakat payment should be tracked for the next hijri year, and then served up to the user if the hijri year passes without it being exhausted. I would also like to give the user the option to view his entire data - income and expenses currently being tracked for zakat, already paid zakat, as well as the date and time when zakat for a specific amount will be due.\n\nwrite entire sqlalchemy code needed for this whole website - ie write the entire models.py file, and also write what needs to be added to the app.py file, with examples of how to modify the database in all the ways that is required for the stated goals.\"\n\nyour response:\n\"Sure, I can help you write the SQLAlchemy code for this web app. Here is the code for models.py:\n\npython\nCopy code\nfrom sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, Float, DateTime, ForeignKey, create\\_engine, text\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import relationship, backref, sessionmaker\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative\\_base\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nBase = declarative\\_base()\n\nclass User(Base):\n \\_\\_tablename\\_\\_ = 'users'\n id = Column(Integer, primary\\_key=True)\n username = Column(String(50), nullable=False, unique=True)\n password = Column(String(50), nullable=False)\n incomes = relationship(\"Income\", back\\_populates=\"user\")\n expenses = relationship(\"Expense\", back\\_populates=\"user\")\n zakat\\_payments = relationship(\"ZakatPayment\", back\\_populates=\"user\")\n\nclass Income(Base):\n \\_\\_tablename\\_\\_ = 'incomes'\n id = Column(Integer, primary\\_key=True)\n amount = Column(Float, nullable=False)\n date = Column(DateTime, nullable=False, default=datetime.utcnow)\n user\\_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('users.id'))\n user = relationship(\"User\", back\\_populates=\"incomes\")\n expenses = relationship(\"Expense\", back\\_populates=\"income\")\n\nclass Expense(Base):\n \\_\\_tablename\\_\\_ = 'expenses'\n id = Column(Integer, primary\\_key=True)\n amount = Column(Float, nullable=False)\n date = Column(DateTime, nullable=False, default=datetime.utcnow)\n user\\_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('users.id'))\n user = relationship(\"User\", back\\_populates=\"expenses\")\n income\\_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('incomes.id'))\n income = relationship(\"Income\", back\\_populates=\"expenses\")\n\nclass ZakatPayment(Base):\n \\_\\_tablename\\_\\_ = 'zakat\\_payments'\n id = Column(Integer, primary\\_key=True)\n amount = Column(Float, nullable=False)\n date\\_paid = Column(DateTime, nullable=False, default=datetime.utcnow)\n income\\_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('incomes.id'))\n income = relationship(\"Income\", back\\_populates=\"zakat\\_payments\")\n user\\_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('users.id'))\n user = relationship(\"User\", back\\_populates=\"zakat\\_payments\")\nIn this code, we define four tables: users, incomes, expenses, and zakat\\_payments. Each table corresponds to a specific model in the web app. The User model represents a user of the app, while the Income and Expense models represent income and expenses, respectively. The ZakatPayment model represents a zakat payment made by a user for a specific income record.\n\nWe also define relationships between the tables using foreign keys and the relationship() function provided by SQLAlchemy. For example, the User model has a one-to-many relationship with both the Income and Expense models, and a one-to-many relationship with the ZakatPayment model. Similarly, the Income model has a one-to-many relationship with the Expense model and a one-to-many relationship with the ZakatPayment model.\n\nHere is an example of how you can use the code in app.py to add and retrieve records from the database:\n\npython\nCopy code\nfrom flask import Flask, request, jsonify\nfrom models import User, Income, Expense, ZakatPayment, Base\nfrom sqlalchemy import create\\_engine\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nimport hijri\\_converter\n\napp = Flask(\\_\\_name\\_\\_)\n\nengine = create\\_engine('sqlite:///zakat.db', echo=True)\nBase.metadata.create\\_all(engine)\nSession = sessionmaker(bind=engine)\nsession = Session()\n\n@app.route('/\"\n\nyou stopped in the middle.

has recently launched an open source package called semantic kernel it's like a framework which helps you integrate large language models within your existing applications for example let's say you've got a gpd4 use case and you already have an application for example a calendar application how do you efficiently integrate the gpt4 inside your calendar application is what you can use semantic kernel for if you heard this and then you thought oh is this related to Lang chain or is this like GPT index exactly Microsoft is coming up with a similar framework what Lang chain has been doing in the python world and Microsoft has started with C sharp I don't know who uses C sharp like I'm not quite familiar with C sharp at this point but it looks like Microsoft is starting with C sharp keeping Microsoft developers in mind and also semantic kernel is coming soon for python so in this video I'm going to show you certain details that I know about semantic kernel I have not tried semantic kernel yet I'm not a c-sharp developer but I'm going to tell you everything that I know about semantic kernel including they've got a free LinkedIn course and how you can build your skills on top of it to start with couple of days back Microsoft put out a block opposing hello semantic kernel and basically what they are saying is semantic kernel is a lightweight SDK like let's say framework that lets you mix conventional programming languages like C sharp and python with large language model AI proms with what kind of things that they can do they can help you with prompt templating which is something that long chain already has got now what is a prompt templating so for example if you want to ask a question why is this why let's say a particular product is bad now instead of having the product hard coded you can have a prompt template in which like you can use like very similar like what you do with if string in Python you can do prompt template there so now that is prompt templating you can do chaining combining multiple responses training is more complicated than multiple responses just planning capabilities so prompt here semantic kernel can help you with prompt templating chaining planning multiple capabilities that's what they have said so now what does it help you do it helps you do certain things for example you want to summarize a Lindy chat that is already on um you know like some platform you can do that or you want to flag an important Next Step that is in Microsoft graph you can do that if you want to plan your next trip along with booking an air ticket you can do that so if you see this is like an automation I don't know how many of you actually know about if this then that there is a very popular application like back in the day um it's a it's an application where you can set rules if this then that so you can set like an automation rule like very similar like with this appear but on the free app version so what you can see here what Microsoft is trying to do is it's trying to bring together that kind of capability within the large language model space for existing developers so they want to capture the existing developers like C sharp developers or python developers who want to integrate large language model capabilities within their application now specifically talking about semantic kernel what is it central to semantic kernel that like the most important thing for semantic kernel is something called a skill now what is this skill going to do the skill can be either of these two so the skill can be a semantic code or a native code now what is the semantic code a semantic code is when you have a large language model prompt an AI prompt for a large language model is semantic code and a native code is like a normal computer code so now a skill is like combination of these functions and these functions could be semantic code or a native code and this combines and then creates the collection of skills the skills that are going to be used for everything else in this now that is skill now the next thing is memory memory is basically context when you have a conversation with charge GPT does charge GPT understand what you said at the start so that context is what memory is and connectors like for example you have got slack in your company you want to use slack data you want to use Google Google sheet data so these are connectors so they are providing you memory connector how you connect this with skill and finally they have something called a planner and we can see see from this picture also they have something called planner now what is a planner planner facilitates you to do complex tasks by taking a user ask and then translating it to skill memory connector so like user would come and say you know I want to do this that that statement from the user is now split into skill memory connector with the help of planner and that's what planner is doing and semantic kernel currently supports even the latest gpd4 and also Azure open a service again I have not tried it myself but it looks quite promising from what is Microsoft doing it almost feels like Microsoft is in like some crazy Nitro mode if you if you're familiar with car race to just ship something every single day and capture this entire large language model so they almost did not capture the browser model or maybe browser was forced on people they had a good operating system but you know still a lot of people love Mac but still Microsoft operating system is quite big they did not do well on the laptop Hardware side they did not do well on the smartphone Hardware side they did not do anything at all on the I mean there was Windows OS but they couldn't capitalize a good Market in the smartphone OS side and search engine we all know it looks like Microsoft wants to really establish themselves as the AI leader in the in the space current space that we have got if you compare it with companies like Google Apple Amazon like the fan companies meta is quite good but generally if you see so semantic kernel looks like your Lang chain equivalent if you are in the Microsoft ecosystem or if you are in let's say C sharp to start with but like I said it's not only C sharp but at this point there is a there is a python preview that is available right now so you can see it's a very simple python code so you can see it's um you import semantic kernel and then use import async IO create the kernel and from there you add some configuration about which model do you want to use um for example fine tuning model like the base model DaVinci which prompting model you want to use open a key after that you create the prompt which is very similar like your prompting template and then you are going to create a semantic function as you can see this is a semantic function it's not a native function so native function would be like simple python code this is semantic function and then you are going to say what do you want to summarize because this is a summarization script and then you run everything and then you get the result so now this is a very simple example of how you can use semantic kernel for a summarization task with open a open GPT 3 in this case it takes wency over 3 GPT 3. 5 now this is also coming and they are going to it's currently it's called preview but it's not finalized but this is currently available so semantic kernel is available for C sharp users python users now if you want to get started with semantic kernel I would strongly encourage you to go read this blog post but again they have come up with this LinkedIn course for free I mean if you do not know Microsoft owns LinkedIn so they have come up with this LinkedIn course where you can learn introduction to semantic kernel who is semantic kernel for what is semantic kernel why do you develop something on semantic kernel rather than you know going native getting started with semantic kernel and then some example sample examples I have not taken the course yet but you can actually see that there are already 513 people actively taking this course and uh 221 9 291 people have bookmarked there is an interest in this course and if you if you are let's say a C sharp developer like a DOT net developer then you should definitely look at semantic kernel so overall if you're a dotnet developer if you're a python developer it's really good for you to get familiarized with this particular World which is a large language model world and a lot of people have been seeing the benefit of using Lang chain as opposed to directly doing something with open a so it provides a lot of this what Microsoft is giving so if you want something alternative to Lang chain or if you want to look at something new from a big corporation like Microsoft definitely this is an open source package but you can bet on a development from a company like Microsoft so if you are looking for this kind of large language model based EI application or if you already have an application which you want to include large language model in it to be powered by AI then semantic kernel is something that definitely you should check out I will link all the required links in the YouTube description I hope this video was helpful to you in learning what does Microsoft schematic kernel and how can you use it what do you do with that if you have any question let me know in the comment section otherwise I will see you in another video\""}

{"text": "2 RELATED WORK\nIn this section, we summarize the related work and restrict our review to meta-learning approaches for AutoML, dataset embeddings,\nand processing tabular structured data.\nLearner and preprocessing selection. In most AutoML systems, learner\nand pre-processing selection for the cold start problem is driven by\na database of actual executions of pipelines and data; e.g., [2], [9],\n[10]. This database often drives both learner selection and hyper\nparameter optimization (HPO), so we focus here more on how the\ndatabase is collected or applied to either problem, since the actual\napplication to learner selection or HPO is less relevant. For HPO,\nsome have cast the application of the database as a multi-task problem (see [27]), where the hyperparameters for cold start are chosen\nbased on multiple related datasets. Others, for instance, [9, 26], compute a database of dataset meta-features on a variety of OpenML\n[29] datasets, including dataset properties such as the number of\nnumerical attributes, the number of samples or skewness of the\nfeatures in each dataset.\nThese systems measure similarity between datasets and use\npipelines from the nearest datasets based on the distance between\nthe datasets’ feature vectors as we do, but the computation of these\nvectors is different, as we describe in detail below. Auto-Sklearn 2.0\n[8] defines instead a static portfolio of pipelines that work across a\nvariety of datasets, and use these to cold-start the learner selection\ncomponent - i.e., every new dataset uses the same set of pipelines.\nOthers have created large matrices documenting the performance\nof candidate pipelines for different datasets and viewed the selection\nof related pipelines as a collaborative filtering problem [10].\nDataset embeddings. The most used mechanism to capture dataset\nfeatures rely on the use of meta-features for a dataset such as\n[9, 26]. These dataset properties vary from simple, such as number\nof classes (see, e.g. [6]), to complex and expensive, such as statistical features (see, e.g. [30]) or landmark features (see, e.g. [24]). As\npointed out in Auto-Sklearn 2.0 [8], these meta-features are not\ndefined with respect to certain column types such as categorical\ncolumns, and they are also expensive to compute, within limited\nbudgets. The dataset embedding we adopt is builds individual column embeddings, and then pools these for a table level embedding.\nSimilar to our approach, Drori et al. [5] use pretrained language\nmodels to get dataset embeddings based on available dataset textual information, e.g. title, description and keywords. Given these\nembeddings, their approach tries to find the most similar datasets\nand their associated baselines. Unlike [5], our approach relies on\nembedding the actual data inside the dataset and not just their\noverall textual description, which in many cases is not available.\nOBOE [34] uses the performance of a few inexpensive, informative\nmodels to compute features of a model.\nPipeline generation. There is a significant amount of work viewing\nthe selection of learners as well as hyperparameters as a bayesian\noptimization problem like [27, 28]. Other systems have used evolutionary algorithms along with user defined templates or grammars\nfor this purpose such as TPOT [16] or Recipe [4]. Still, others have\nviewed the problem of pipeline generation as a probabilistic matrix\nfactorization [10], an AI planning problem when combined with\na user specified grammar [15, 32], a bayesian optimization problem combined with Monte Carlo Tree Search [25], or an iterative\nalternating direction method of multipliers optimization (ADMM)\nproblem [20]. Systems like VolcanoML focus on an efficient decomposition of the search space [18]. To the best of our knowledge,\nKGpip is the first system to cast the actual generation of pipelines\nas a neural graph generation problem.\nSome recent AutoML systems have moved away from the fairly\nlinear pipelines generated by most earlier systems to use ensembles\nor stacking extensively. H2O for instance uses fast random search\nin combination with ensembling for the problem of generating\npipelines [17]. Others rely on \"stacking a bespoke set of models in\na predefined order\", where stacking and training is handled in a\nspecial manner to achieve strong performance [7]. Similarly, PIPER\n[21] uses a greedy best-first search algorithm to traverse the space\nof partial pipelines guided over a grammar that defines complex\npipelines such as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). The pipelines\nproduced by PIPER are more complex than the linear structures used\nin the current AutoML systems we use to test our ideas for historical\npipeline modeling, and we do not use ensembling techniques yet\nin our approach. Neither is precluded, however, because KGpip\nmeta-learning model can generate any type of structures, including\ncomplex structures that mined pipelines may have.\n2429\nFigure 1: An overview of KGpip’s meta-learning approach for\nmining a database of ML pipelines to train a graph generator\nmodel to predict ML pipeline skeletons in the form of graphs."}

{"text": "Kamisato Ayato[Note 1] (Japanese: 神里綾人 Kamisato Ayato) is a playable Hydro character in Genshin Impact.\n\nHe is the current head of the Kamisato Clan, the older brother of Kamisato Ayaka, and the Yashiro Commissioner. Resourceful and cunning, Ayato keeps a lower profile than his sister and focuses on government affairs in the Commission. \n\nAyato uses the tall male model. He has long pale blue asymmetrical shoulder-length hair, pale skin, and light purple eyes. He also has a small mole under the left corner of his mouth. \n\nSilk Splendor (try not to use that name in actual story) is Kamisato Ayato's Default Character Outfit. \n\nAyato's attire consists of a white collared coat with long flowing sleeves, dark blue lapels, and gold trimmings decorated with a number of embellishments worn over a light purple kimono and white pants. He also has black and golden armor on his right shoulder, white and purple gauntlets on both arms, black gloves, and a large golden rope around his neck. His Vision hangs on a thick golden rope around his waist on his right hip. \n\nAyato is a person that does not like to show his face in public often, preferring to work on his duties as the Yashiro Commissioner. A well-known fact about him is that he's extremely busy and stressed, as he has to deal with corrupt government officials while juggling his duty as the leader of the Shuumatsuban. Due to his duties, he loathes small talk, wanting people to get to the point. He uses a large array of methods to deal with corrupt officials, usually within legal bounds.\n\nWhile he is not particularly well known due to his preference to remain behind the scenes, those who are familiar with him note that he is incredibly kind and has inspired loyalty from many people. For example, Hirotatsu states that he continues to serve the Yashiro Commission to repay the generosity that he showed him and his master and it is strongly implied that Ayato was the one who inspired Thoma to the point the latter received a Vision. Ayato has stated that he highly values loyalty and obedience (hence his preference for dogs), as strongly implied that there were numerous assassinations against him in the past, hence why he values those two traits so much to protect himself from rival clans and organizations.[2][3]\n\nDespite his succession as the family head at a young age, he appears to be a mature and determined man, notably even more than Ayaka, who's known for her steadfastness. Like Ayaka, Ayato cares for the well-being of the common people. He is also a family man, as he had taken the position of Commissioner per his parents' wishes to also protect Ayaka, stating that he would not forgive any who would harm his family and wanting to ensure that Ayaka had others to rely on when she needed it.[4] He also risked his life to smuggle the Watatsumi Army into Tenshukaku for the sake of doing a \"small favor\" for her.\n\nAyato is also known to be cunning and mischievous, as both the Shogun and Yae Miko note him as unpredictable and tricky to understand, with the latter strongly disliking him as a result. Nonetheless, he is tolerated by both for upholding the Shogun's will for the former and their duties generally aligning for the latter. Hiratsuka notes that whenever he hangs out with Thoma, he ropes him into eating strange food, causing Thoma to become terrified whenever he sees him. Itto remarks that Ayato is a \"warrior\" with great charisma, and that the two are \"on the same wavelength\". He is also able to find Sayu with ease despite not appearing to have much ninja training, even though the rest of the Shuumatsuban have difficulty locating her."}

Crystal clear\nrivers wind their way through evergreen valleys.\nThereby, passing fruit trees and endless fi elds,\ntilled by people with velvety skin, who might not be\nthe ones who enjoy this abundance. Ambros is the\nHedonists‘ home, they rule this realm and in earlier\ndays many others with their wealth. In Ambros,\nthere is nothing that makes your days appear idle.\nTo the east, it borders the Liquid Meadows and in\nthe north the emerald prairies of the Litikal Planes.\nHEDONISTS\nA nation of people who put lust and pleasure at the\ncenter of their being. The Hedonists live their days\nin pure bliss and should problems arise, they surely\ncan be solved by throwing money at it. Even the\nlow-ranking workers among them are rich enough\nto indulge in luxuries that the inhabitants of the\nother realms could only dream of. Certainly, such\nopulence attracts envy, which is not really welcome\nin Ambros.\nTo ward these people off, the top Hedonists chose\nthe most noble within their own ranks to be Prae-\ntorians; elite warriors who dedicate their lives to\nfi ghting with the two-handed sword against anyone\nwho threatens the improving lifestyle of the higher-\nranking Hedonists. Additionally, since the Ultracore\npact, they have been responsible for its protection\nand the order in the Core Nation. When the World\nEnder robbed uncounted people of Tormentosia\nof their homes, the troops of the Praetorians were\nincreased at the request of Queen Julia of Ambros\nand common people were also allowed to join their\nranks.\nThe Hedonists live in a clearly hierarchical society\nthat attaches tremendous importance to nobility,\nancestry and generally descent. Other nations are\ntreated in a rather derogatory manner. They see\nthe Ultracore pact as more of a necessary evil than\nsomething they value.\nin pure bliss and should problems arise, they surely\n06\nASCILIATH\nAsciliath is an ancient realm, buried under snow\nand shrouded in never ending darkness. Its high,\nrazor-sharp mountain peaks keep the clouds\nfi rmly under their control, so that hardly any light\nreaches the damp, swampy plains of the country.\nMoss-covered creatures roam its plains, avoiding\nthe light and the caves. For in the caves of Asci-\nliath live the Nosmerians. They built their capital,\nHabitat 001 deep within the caverns right on top of\nthe ruins of the old world and its remains. This was\na choice made not least because of the Rudiments\nwho ply their strange trades in the caves of Asci-\nliath. Creatures half alive, half dead, half fl esh, and\nhalf machine, controlled by an ancient logic that the\nNosmerians hope to understand one day. Asciliath\nborders the Jungles of Initos to the north and shares\na border with the Liquid Meadows to the west.\nNOSMERIANS\nNosmerians are Vampire-like beings that feed on\nthe blood of the unfortunate souls who get lost\nin the depths of their caves. Nosmerians may not\nbe numerous, but they are nonetheless one of the\nmost powerful races in all of Tormentosia. Through\nongoing studies of the ruins of ancient civilizations,\nthey have succeeded in writing complex programs\nthat allow them to outsmart life itself.\nThey have developed a technology known as “Brio\nHarvesting” which allows them to literally suck the\nlife force out of their poor victims. Due to this, they\nmanaged to unnaturally prolong their own lives.\nOnce drained of their life force, their sucked-out\nvictims are equipped with a central processor and\nthen fi ght as mindless Rud-ghouls, following the\nwill of the Nosmerians. All other races condemn\nand fear this practice.\nIn the Eternal Wars the Nosmerians initially\nseemed outnumbered, but then they plundered\nthe battlefi elds and let their enemies fi ght their\nformer comrades. The Nosmerians live in deep\ncaves to protect their skin from sunlight. If they\nleave their burrows, they wrap their pale bodies in\noccult-looking wide robes in which they carry their\npunch cards. These contain the valuable programs\nthat the Recountants have designed. In the Habitat-\n001, as they call their capital, they communicate\nwith Cobol - the Timeless Ruling Algorithm. This\nprogram is a vast collection of punch cards that the\nmost remarkable Recountants created and uploaded\ninto a former ruler‘s lifeless body. It is constantly\nbeing expanded and makes all the crucial decisions\nfor the Nosmerians.\nthat allow them to outsmart life itself.\nfor the Nosmerians.\n07\nASH MOUNTAINS\nBarren and dreary, the Ash Mountains lie in the\nnorth of Tormentosia. Since the beginning of the\nwar and even in the period before, they have defi ed\nall attempts to conquer them. No tree or bush\nhas grown wild since the great dragon Ardorcor\nengulfed the mountains in fl ames over 5000 years\nago.\nFlora and fauna has adapted to the inhospitable\nlandscape, altering their previous forms to survive\nin the harsh environment created by the dragons‘\nfi re. Hardly any inhabitant of the free world, who\ndoes not belong to the folk of the Steam Dwarfs,\ndares to set foot in this country. However, everyone\nwho has war in mind is sincerely welcome. The\ncapital of the empire is the machine city Par; some\nalso disparagingly tend to call the town Smoulder-\nborough.\nThe Ash Mountains, due to their cauldron-like loca-\ntion with three borders facing the outer shield, have\nbeen subject to constant attacks from the Devourer\nof Worlds and his army. The Steam Dwarfs fi ght an\nimpressive defensive against the never ending fl ood\nof enemies but their power is slowly dwindling.\nSTEAM DWARFS\nWhat is certain is that their technology, which is\nalmost exclusively based on fi re and steam, bene-\nfi ted from the lava and hot springs in the Ash\nMountains, and so they settled there for good.\nTheir society is rough and based on customs and\nrituals so old that no one can remember where they\nonce came from. Carved into stone, they adorn the\nKinetic Throne in the capital of Par from which the\nsixty-fi fth supreme Steamgeneral Cromankus Steel-\nsplint leads his people. He is a strict but just ruler\nwho honors the Ultracore agreement, but has not\nforgotten that it is concluded with former enemies.\nThe Steam Dwarfs rely on their machines and\nmechanisms. They have made nature subser-\nvient to themselves, and with the help of elaborate\nsystems, they use the nutrient rich ashes to culti-\nvate mushrooms, which they solely live on. They\nbrew Sporebeer out of it, which also functions in\nits more potent version as fuel for their machines.\nThey honor what steams and smokes, and are skep-\ntical of everything else.\nof enemies but their power is slowly dwindling.\n07\n08\nTHE JUNGLES OF INITOS\nThe name of this infested area is almost mislea-\nding. Little has remained of the jungle that gave\nInitos its original name since the Genetics settled\nhere. Now decaying scrub and contaminated water\nmark the landscape. You can only cross the country\non its paved paths, and within the gnarled forests,\nmarauders and mutated animals are up to no good.\nLegends say that Initos once held the largest and\nmost impressive human settlement. From these\ntimes, however, only ruins and wreckage remained,\nin which now the strangest creatures lurk. Even\ndeserters from Sorgoth are said to rove about here.\nToday the capital of Initos is Moloch - the mutant\ncity. From here, the Supreme Modifi cation Czar\nPutrascha the Great reigns over her subjects.\nGENETICS\nWith boundless cruelty and no scruples, these\nformer humans experimented on their bodies to\n„modify“ themselves to be this way. Their society\nis based on strength and violence. Thus if you have\nsuperior eyesight, thicker legs, or even a bone blade\ninstead of a forearm, you will rise rapidly within\ntheir ranks. Over the years a society has emerged,\nin which not always the wisest, but instead the\nstrongest would rule.\nThe Genetics fi ght with relatively primitive\nweapons. You don‘t need more than that if you can\nswing a third mace thanks to an additional arm or if\nyou are simply three meters tall. Even bows are too\ncomplex for most representatives of these people,\nso they tend to be close combatants. Only the Tonic\nTossers throw poisonous fuming tinctures at their\nenemies or spray them from their Vaporators. With\ntheir Vaporators, the Tonic Tossers shoot burning\ngases that scorch enemies with mutagenic toxic\nmist that weakens them, or even healing clouds\nthat strengthen their allies. Protected by the piles of\nmuscle and meat in their front ranks, they complete\nthe Genetics army.\nAll the nations of Tormentosia fear the Genetics.\nThey are the only ones who go into battle with the\nWorld Ender without any dread, while still brin-\nging it into the hearts of their enemies.\n09\nTHE LIQUID MEADOWS\nNo place in Tormentosia is anywhere near as\nfamous for its beauty as the Liquid Meadows.\nEmerald, moss-overgrown meadows are inter-\nrupted by broad rivers, which often cascade and\nfl ow into lush valleys. Water stairs as far as the eye\ncan see and in the middle temples, statues and sett-\nlements. The inhabitants of these planes call them-\nselves Children of the Source and nothing is more\nsacred to them than water and life. Thousands upon\nthousands of plants grow here, and even the most\nwell-read scholars cannot name them all.\nThe country has no capital. Instead, small sett-\nlements cover the area as the inhabitants of the\nplains are plentiful and love peace. However,\ndecisions are still made by a queen. Her name is\n“Jalkassa the Roaming”, and she travels the country\nconstantly with her court. She also chose this\nway of life because of the stabilizing power of the\nAquanopticum, the sacred source of magic. It is no\nlonger capable of keeping the land and its endless\nfalling waters in balance if it remains in one place.\nTherefore, it must be frequently carried across the\ncountry to supply all corners with its force. Other-\nwise, everything will collapse, and devastating\nfl oods would be the consequence.\nTo the east, the waters of the Liquid Meadows\nrun into Asciliath, and to the west, they approach\nthe numerous gardens of Ambros. In the south,\nthe great falls protect the country from attacking\nenemies, and so its inhabitants are the only nation\nthat does not live in constant war.\nCHILDREN OF THE SOURCE\nBlue-skinned, peaceful humanoids who have settled\nin the southern Liquid Meadows. They care little\nabout the concerns of other nations and even their\nrole in the Eternal Wars was surprisingly marginal.\nThrough clever trade agreements and diplom-\natic solutions, they avoided invasions or unneces-\nsary battles and instead devoted themselves to the\npersistent exploration of the Aqua. They can now\nstore and release this essence of water. Due to this,\nthey can use magic that no other being of Tormen-\ntosia can even imagine and have founded a religion\naround this magical resource that dominates their\nsociety.\nThey live in small communities that are spread\nacross the country. With boats they call Wind\nDaggers, which are also equipped with wheels,\nthey travel quickly through the vast landscapes\nusing the lush winds of the plains as propulsion.\nEven their ruler “Jalkassa the Roaming” constantly\ntravels through the country and visits her subjects.\nIn recent history, the Children of the Source have\ncontinued their research on the Aqua and now are\neven capable of using it as a weapon.\nThe country has no capital. Instead, small sett-\nlements cover the area as the inhabitants of the\nplains are plentiful and love peace. However,\ndecisions are still made by a queen. Her name is\n“Jalkassa the Roaming”, and she travels the country\nconstantly with her court. She also chose this\nway of life because of the stabilizing power of the\nAquanopticum, the sacred source of magic. It is no\nlonger capable of keeping the land and its endless\nfalling waters in balance if it remains in one place.\nTherefore, it must be frequently carried across the\ncountry to supply all corners with its force. Other-\nwise, everything will collapse, and devastating\nfl oods would be the consequence.\nTo the east, the waters of the Liquid Meadows\nrun into Asciliath, and to the west, they approach\nthe numerous gardens of Ambros. In the south,\nthe great falls protect the country from attacking\nenemies, and so its inhabitants are the only nation\nthat does not live in constant war.\nsociety.\nThey live in small communities that are spread\nacross the country. With boats they call Wind\nDaggers, which are also equipped with wheels,\nthey travel quickly through the vast landscapes\nusing the lush winds of the plains as propulsion.\nEven their ruler “Jalkassa the Roaming” constantly\ntravels through the country and visits her subjects.\nIn recent history, the Children of the Source have\ncontinued their research on the Aqua and now are\neven capable of using it as a weapon.\n10\nTHE LITIKAL PLANES\nThis vast but fertile land lies in an enormous crater.\nIn the north, it borders on the Ash Mountains, in\nthe south on the rich country of Ambros. A cons-\ntant cold wind blows across these lands and thus\nprevents the growth of larger plants in wide parts\nof the tundra plains. However, this unique nature\nmade it possible that the most giant creatures of\nall of Tormentosia originated here - the dinosaurs.\nThese mighty reptilian beings roam the extensive\nlands of the Litikal Planes.\nWhoever makes their way to the capital of the\nkingdom Megalospoli, should ensure their protec-\ntion by a Sauromancer escort beforehand, because\nthey can fi nd the wandering city, which is carried\non the back of the mighty lizard Megalos. Only, the\nSauromancers know all of the sometimes-terrifying\ncreatures wreaking havoc throughout the plains\nand are able to safely navigate around them.\nSAUROMANCER\nDinosaurs are honored but also tamed and used\nfor different purposes. Their entire economy and\nsociety revolve around these beasts - either as\nworking animals, machines of war, or, last but not\nleast, as homes. This is the reason why during the\nEternal War they were particularly feared. They\ncould breach hostile defensive lines and, with cons-\ntant reinforcements from their capital, let chaos\nrain down on their enemies.\nThey are humanoids with tough skin that appears\nto be almost scaly. Hissing and screeching are how\nmost strangers would describe their language.\nTheir society has no defi nitive leader as they live\nin independent tribal associations. All signifi cant\ntribes send representatives to Megalospoli, from\nwhere they make decisions together. They mostly\nrely on spears, razor staves, and the occasional\nsling when it comes to armament - everything you\ncan operate from the back of a dinosaur.\n10\nSauromancers pride themselves as the oldest nation\nof all of Tormentosia. Even among the fi rst cave\npaintings discovered by the Recountants of the\nvampires in Asciliath there were images of Sauro-\nmancers on their monumental riding beasts."}

Customers wish to avoid calling back to a central PDP due to latency and single point of failure so the architecture will support a distributed “offline” PDP model which, if the spike is successful, would be fulfilled by OPA. Distributed OPA instances would “pull” down just the JSON data needed for the applications they serve as PDP. The OPA PDP should offer a variety of authorization calls/endpoint methods such as: 1) asking for all specific UI resources for which the user has any access assignment in that app, 2) passing a username, application, optionally a resource, and a right and retrieving all context/constraints/field type values the user has for that right cross their assignments. 3) passing a username, application, right, optional resource, and constraint values and returning a true/false authorization decision. 4) passing a username, application, database table name, and returning the constraints to be used/injected as where clause filters in the apps data access layer. \n\nThese are just some of the scenarios we wish to support. For the initial spike, we want to use JSON data that is an approximation of the PBAC policy data in EmpowerID and create a rego file that we can test in a simple .NET app to validate this as a workable solution. After this is proven, we’ll move into the details of designing various best practice application templates or an SDK to leverage this new model and then the harder work of how we will support the data flow for this distributed OPA model where the data lives in a central SQL database but is shipped or pulled down to distributed OPA instances. \n\nCan you guys sync up and get rolling on the basics of our spike on Monday? I can join various calls if possible but I really want this to roll fast so we can present some preliminary results to Daimler by the end of the week. \""}

Ujunwa began to jump up and down, babbling nonsense to mimic Conrad’s Africans, feeling the sweet lightness of wine in her head. The Zimbabwean staggered and fell into the water fountain and climbed out spluttering, her dreadlocks wet, saying she had felt some fish wriggling around in there. The Kenyan said he would use that for his story— fish in the fancy resort fountain—since he really had no idea what he was going to write about. The Senegalese said her story was really her story, about how she mourned her girlfriend and how her grieving had emboldened her to come out to her parents although they now treated her being a lesbian as a mild joke and continued to speak of the families of suitable young men. The black South African looked alarmed when he heard “lesbian.” He got up and walked away. The Kenyan said the black South African reminded him of his father, who attended a Holy Spirit Revival church and didn’t speak to people on the street because they were not saved. The Zimbabwean, Tanzanian, white South African, and Senegalese all spoke about their fathers. They looked at Ujunwa and she realized that she was the only one who had said nothing, and for a moment the wine no longer fogged her mind. She shrugged and mumbled that there was really little to say about her father. He was a normal person. “Is he in your life?” the Senegalese asked, with the soft tone that meant she assumed he was not, and for the first time her Francophone accent irritated Ujunwa. “He is in my life,” Ujunwa said with a quiet force. “He was the one who bought me books when I was a child and the one who read my early poems and stories.” She paused, and everyone was looking at her and she added, “He did something that surprised me. It hurt me, too, but mostly it surprised me.” The Senegalese looked as if she wanted to ask more but changed her mind and said she wanted more wine. “Are you writing about your father?” the Kenyan asked and Ujunwa answered with an emphatic NO because she had never believed in fiction as therapy. The Tanzanian told her that all fiction was therapy, some sort of therapy, no matter what anybody said. That evening, Ujunwa tried to write, but her eyeballs were swimming and her head was aching and so she went to bed. After breakfast, she sat before the laptop and cradled a cup of tea. Chioma gets a call from Merchant Trust bank, one of the places her father contacted. He knows the chairman of the board. She is hopeful; all the bank people she knows drive nice secondhand Jettas and have nice flats in Gbagada. The deputy manager interviews her. He is dark and good-looking and his glasses have an elegant designer logo on the frames and, as he speaks to her, she desperately wishes he would notice her. He doesn’t. He tells her that they would like to hire her to do marketing, which will mean going out and bringing in new accounts. She will be working with Yinka. If she can bring in ten million naira during her trial period, she will be guaranteed a permanent position. She nods as he speaks. She is used to men’s attention and is sulky that he does not look at her as a man looks at a woman, and she does not quite understand what he means by going out to get new accounts until she starts the job two weeks later. A uniformed driver takes her and Yinka in an air-conditioned official Jeep—she runs her hand over the smooth leather seat, is reluctant to climb out—to the home of an alhaji in Ikoyi. The alhaji is avuncular and expansive with his smile, his hand gestures, his laughter. Yinka has already come to see him a few times before and he hugs her and says something that makes her laugh. He looks at Chioma. “This one is too fine,” he says. A steward serves frosted glasses of chapman. The alhaji speaks to Yinka but looks often at Chioma. Then he asks Yinka to come closer and explain the high-interest savings accounts to him and then he asks her to sit on his lap and doesn’t she think he’s strong enough to carry her? Yinka says of course he is and sits on his lap, smiling a serene smile. Yinka is small and fair; she reminds Chioma of the Yellow Woman. What Chioma knows of the Yellow Woman is what her mother told her. One slow afternoon, the Yellow Woman had walked into her mother’s boutique on Adeniran Ogunsanya Street. Her mother knew who the Yellow Woman was, knew the relationship with her husband had been on for a year, knew that he had paid for the Yellow Woman’s Honda Accord and her flat in Ilupeju. But what drove her mother crazy was the insult of this: the Yellow Woman coming to her boutique, looking at shoes and planning to pay for them with money that really belonged to her husband. So her mother yanked at the Yellow Woman’s weave-on that hung to her back and screamed “Husband snatcher!” and the salesgirls joined in, slapping and beating the Yellow Woman until she ran out to her car. When Chioma’s father heard of it, he shouted at her mother and said she had acted like one of those wild women from the street, had disgraced him, herself, and an innocent woman for nothing. Then he left the house. Chioma came back from National Youth Service and noticed that her father’s wardrobe was empty. Aunty Elohor, Aunty Rose, and Aunty Uche had all come and said to her mother, “We are prepared to go with you and beg him to come back home or we will go and beg on your behalf.” Chioma’s mother said, “Never, not in this world. I am not going to beg him. It is enough.” Aunty Funmi came and said the Yellow Woman had tied him up with medicine and she knew a good babalawo who could untie him. Chioma’s mother said, “No, I am not going.” Her boutique was failing, because Chioma’s father had always helped her import shoes from Dubai. So she lowered prices, advertised in Joy and City People, and started stocking shoes made in Aba. Chioma is wearing a pair of those shoes the morning she sits in the alhaji’s sitting room and watches Yinka, perched on the expansive lap, talking about the benefits of a savings account with Merchant Trust Bank. . . . At first, Ujunwa tried not to notice that Edward often stared at her body, that his eyes were never on her face but always lower. The workshop days had taken on a routine of breakfast at eight and lunch at one and dinner at six in the grand dining room. On the sixth day, a blisteringly hot day, Edward handed out copies of the first story to be reviewed, written by the Zimbabwean. The participants were all seated on the terrace, and after he handed out the papers, Ujunwa saw that all the seats under the umbrellas were occupied. “I don’t mind sitting in the sun,” she said, already getting up. “Would you like me to stand up for you, Edward?” “I’d rather like you to lie down for me,” he said. The moment was humid, thick; a bird cawed from far away. Edward was grinning. Only the Ugandan and the Tanzanian had heard him. Then the Ugandan laughed. And Ujunwa laughed, because it was funny and witty, she told herself, when you really thought about it. After lunch, she took a walk with the Zimbabwean and as they stopped to pick up shells by the sea, Ujunwa wanted to tell her what Edward had said. But the Zimbabwean seemed distracted, less chatty than usual; she was probably anxious about her story. Ujunwa read it that evening. She thought the writing had too many flourishes, but she liked the story and wrote appreciations and careful suggestions in the margins. It was familiar and funny, about a Harare secondary schoolteacher whose Pentecostal minister tells him that he and his wife will not have a child until they get a confession from the witches who have tied up his wife’s womb. They become convinced that the witches are their next-door neighbors, and every morning they pray loudly, throwing verbal Holy Ghost bombs over the fence. After the Zimbabwean read an excerpt the next day, there was a short silence around the dining table. Then the Ugandan spoke and said there was much energy in the prose. The white South African nodded enthusiastically. The Kenyan disagreed. Some of the sentences tried so hard to be literary that they didn’t make sense, he said, and he read one such sentence. The Tanzanian man said a story had to be looked at as a whole and not in parts. Yes, the Kenyan agreed, but each part had to make sense in order to form a whole that made sense. Then Edward spoke. The writing was certainly ambitious, but the story itself begged the question “So what?” There was something terribly passé about it when one considered all the other things happening in Zimbabwe under the horrible Mugabe. Ujunwa stared at Edward. What did he mean by “passé”? How could a story so true be passé? But she did not ask what Edward meant and the Kenyan did not ask and the Ugandan did not ask and all the Zimbabwean did was shove her dreadlocks away from her face, cowries clinking. Everyone else remained silent. Soon they all began to yawn and say good night and walk to their cabins. The next day, they did not talk about the previous evening. They talked about how fluffy the scrambled eggs were and how eerie the jacaranda leaves that rustled against their windows at night were. After dinner, the Senegalese read from her story. It was a windy night and they shut the door to keep out the sound of the whirling trees. The smoke from Edward’s pipe hung over the room. The Senegalese read two pages of a funeral scene, stopping often to sip some water, her accent thickening as she became more emotional, each t sounding like a z. Afterwards, everyone turned to Edward, even the Ugandan, who seemed to have forgotten that he was workshop leader. Edward chewed at his pipe thoughtfully before he said that homosexual stories of this sort weren’t reflective of Africa, really. “Which Africa?” Ujunwa blurted out. The black South African shifted on his seat. Edward chewed further at his pipe. Then he looked at Ujunwa in the way one would look at a child who refused to keep still in church and said that he wasn’t speaking as an Oxford-trained Africanist, but as one who was keen on the real Africa and not the imposing of Western ideas on African venues. The Zimbabwean and Tanzanian and white South African began to shake their heads as Edward was speaking. “This may indeed be the year 2000, but how African is it for a person to tell her family that she is homosexual?” Edward asked. The Senegalese burst out in incomprehensible French and then, a minute of fluid speech later, said, “I am Senegalese! I am Senegalese!” Edward responded in equally swift French and then said in English, with a soft smile, “I think she had too much of that excellent Bordeaux,” and some of the participants chuckled. Ujunwa was the first to leave. She was close to her cabin when she heard somebody call her and she stopped. It was the Kenyan. The Zimbabwean and the white South African were with him. “Let’s go to the bar,” the Kenyan said. She wondered where the Senegalese was. In the bar, she drank a glass of wine and listened to them talk about how the other guests at Jumping Monkey Hill —all of whom were white—looked at the participants suspiciously. The Kenyan said a youngish couple had stopped and stepped back a little as he approached them on the path from the swimming pool the day before. The white South African said she got suspicious looks, too, perhaps because she wore only kente-print caftans. Sitting there, staring out into the black night, listening to the drink-softened voices around her, Ujunwa felt a self-loathing burst open in the bottom of her stomach. She should not have laughed when Edward said “I’d rather like you to lie down for me.” It had not been funny. It had not been funny at all. She had hated it, hated the grin on his face and the glimpse of greenish teeth and the way he always looked at her chest rather than her face, the way his eyes climbed all over her, and yet she had made herself laugh like a deranged hyena. She put down her half-finished glass of wine and said, “Edward is always looking at my body.” The Kenyan and the white South African and Zimbabwean stared at her. Ujunwa repeated, “Edward is always looking at my body.” The Kenyan said it was clear from the first day that the man would be climbing on top of that flat stick of a wife and\n=== END OF CHUNK ==="}

{"text": "rewrite this article \"Giving you the skills and confidence to deliver excellent change. \nWhether you’re new to change management or an old hand, sometimes finding the right method can be tricky. \n\nWe know all you really want is a method that’s practical and easy to understand and apply.\n\nWe are sharing our experience with people everywhere, so you have the skills and confidence to deliver excellent change. \n\nWhy ABCDE? Because it’s as easy as ABC, that’s why. \nIt’s our ‘paint by numbers’ approach to getting things done. \nWe’ve combined our decades of experience to come up with this common-sense guide to good change management. But we know that common sense isn’t that common. So, we’ve put some structure and practical steps into it to take you to success.\n\nWe’ll start by giving you an introduction to change. Then, we’ll introduce the A, B, C, D, E way to you. Our article authors have got a combined record of over 50 years of project and programme management delivery between us. We’ve been around the block a few times, and we know what we’re talking about.\n\nABCDE Methodology\nThe ABCDE Way\nThis introduction will take you through:\nthe basic principles of change\nwhy change management is even a ‘thing’\nwhat to expect from our ABCDE method\nBy the end of ABCDE, we’re confident you’ll have everything you need to have a go yourselves.\n\nWe’ll share our war wounds and experience so you can see how to avoid the common pitfalls and where to focus the most effort. We’ll show you how to make sure you’re clear on why you should do this change and, how to get everyone and everything ready to receive it. We hope you enjoy our first chapter.\n\nWhat is change?\nLet’s start by asking a simple question, what is change? Everybody knows what the word change means, but what do we mean in this context?\n\nChange is an act or a process through which something becomes different. And therefore, change management is managing the process by which something becomes different. Or as I like to call it, common sense. Or, more simply again, ‘structured common sense,’ because that’s what change management is all about.\n\nIn our experience working on change programmes for many years, the thing about common sense is, is it’s not that common. I’ve seen many fundamental mistakes made time and time again. It doesn’t need to be that way. That’s why we try and manage through change management.\n\nChange can cover anything from:\nplugging in some new IT\nimproving some processes\nmaking some people changes\nmoving to a new office or closing an old one\nsomething you’ve just got to get done this year\nOr, a combination of all the above.\n\nMost of the change projects that we get involved in will have some element of systems, processes, and people combined to come up with an outcome change.\n\nOne of the things I’d like you to remember, is that people don’t always see change positively. That’s one of the key things that we must deal with when we’re doing change management. Recognising that not everyone will be ready for the change is an important thing. It will help you tailor your approach to best suit the situation.\n\nThe Change Curve\nThe change curve\nThe Change Curve\nThe change curve helps us think about how people react to change and upheaval.\nAlong the bottom is time and the side axis up is morale, energy, performance, confidence. Some people will experience shock, i.e., “I can’t believe this is happening.”\n\nThen people will get to a point of denial. “It will never happen.”\n\nThen they may experience anger, “It’s not fair.”\n\nThey may go through the bargaining stage where, “I’ll do whatever it takes.” Or, “I’ll do something to prevent it.” They might then reach the pit of the change curve, which is the depression point, e.g., “What is the point in this thing?”\n\nBut then we start to look forward, rather than look back at what’s happening. We start to get through acceptance and into problem solving and ultimately, engagement and enthusiasm.\n\nThe quicker you can get people through the ‘looking back’ stage and onto the looking forward stage, the better from a change management perspective. \n\nInteresting stuff isn’t it; can you relate? Perhaps you’ve moved house recently or experienced a change in your personal life? Even when we can see something good in the change, it can be tricky to process it and accept it. A good method for managing change can make it easier to swallow.\n\nWe could rattle on about this for hours, but there’s two books there which we recommend reading if you can find some time: Our Iceberg Is Melting and Who Moved My Cheese?\n\nThey’re both brought to life with very simple anecdotes about penguins on icebergs and mice and cheese to bring to help understand the change curve and how folk deal with it.\n\nOur Iceberg is Melting by John Kotter\nOur Iceberg Is Melting by John Kotter\nWho Moved My Cheese by Dr Spencer Johnson\nWho Moved My Cheese by Dr Spencer Johnson\nWhat are your reasons for change?\nYou might want to grow your business or part of your business.\nYou might want to attract new markets, sell more products or services, find niches, buy other businesses\nPerhaps you’ve got to make some change. There might be a regulatory reason or some new rules that require you to do something different.\nJust be ‘better’ than today in some other measurable way.\nThere might be a desire to simplify your business. That might mean complex multiple processes or procedures, organisational designs that people will find hard to understand. You just may want to make that stuff leaner and simpler.\n\nAnother reason for change is outgrowing your competitors. We’d all like to do that I’m sure. These days our customers are much more demanding of service. Unless you’re different from the rest, you’re just noise. There’s no differentiating value proposition. “Why should I buy from you?”\n\nSo, we may need to do something different that will require us to change our business to stand out amongst our competitors.\n\nYou might need to adapt to the market changes around you. The last few years have certainly shown us that! Coming out of the pandemic perhaps we face societal changes and the so-called ‘new normals’ such as more remote working, a greater reliance on service delivery that doesn’t rely on us all being in the same place. We may need to change our business to keep up with market trends. We may wish to improve our business, to make it more desirable, to attract the very best employees and customers. There are loads of great reasons to make changes!\n\nThe winners amongst us are the ones that are most adaptable and able to change and embrace it best. The pace of change continues to pick up rapidly. A few years back, change could be quite slow and methodical, now businesses more and more are taking risks in making change quicker, because if they don’t take that risk to make that change, then they’re going to fall behind their competitors.\n\nBe a winner and use our ABCDE method to help you land your change.\" as a viral linkedin post"}

{"text": "Can you summarize this in 100 words: \"One of the biggest hurdles slowing growth at Eat Unrestricted is the high unit production cost of our cheese sauce due to the fact it is a specialty item that is extremely diet inclusive. Our mission prevents us from taking shortcuts with the ingredient list and packaging. As a result our sourcing and product is unsustainably expensive currently, with potential partners often suggesting we sacrifice on our quality and mission to increase manufacturability and decrease unit cost. However, we have identified a strategy to solve this issue. Reworking our formulation so that our product can become shelf stable would allow us to produce and store high volumes of our cheese sauce, taking advantage of economies of scale and increasing the life of each unit. This would also increase manufacturability and reduce the cost of working with a co-packer on initial batch runs of our cheese sauce. This is also a major cost barrier in its own right as co-packers are typically more wary of new products and seek to mitigate risk with high costs on initial batch runs. However, using a co-packer to produce would dramatically reduce our cost per unit, especially when combining that economies of scale regarding ingredient procurement and the extended shelf life. \nWith that being said, after speaking with several labs and food scientists we can estimate that the cost of test and development around getting our products shelf stable while maintaining the quality and taste would be between $5000 and $10,000. The rest of the grant would be used for our initial batch run with a co-packer we intend to partner with in Tennessee. Any remaining funds would be used for a renewed marketing campaign around our shelf stable products targeting both our D2C channels as well as our current and potential retail partners. \n\""}

Perfect weight perfect fit all good. My problem is that I needed two of them. I have a 10 year old boy and an eight year old girl who are nearly the same size. I almost ordered two of another product, labeled for girls, because it didn’t look like it could be specifically for girls but I really didn’t want to risk making my son wear a “girly” hoodie so I looked for one that was for boys. I found this one and paid seven dollars more than the other because it said for boys. When they arrived the absolute only difference is that inside the hood around the neck the “boys” hoodie has blue stitching. I won’t return this one because it was only seven dollars more, but it kind of irritated me that the other was labeled for girls when there’s nothing different about the two, except the cost.\nOne person found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport abuse\n Dee Harb\n5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect basic hoodie\nReviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 9, 2023\nSize: LargeColor: WhiteVerified Purchase\nPurchased this hoodie in a size large for my 70lb, 55inch tall and slim 10 year old. It fit him perfectly but it will not fit him next year. He loves how soft and warm the fabric is, and has said it is his favorite hoodie. The white is a pure white and does get easily dirty, but nothing that a tide stick can’t handle.\nHelpful\nIs this a true gender neutral product, or is it only for one of the genders? What's the indication from the product description, if any?

People usually work 24/7 to produce food, or hunt, or fix things, sew clothes etc. so they are pretty much brutal to everyone's health issues, including their own. It's pretty much the wild west, or the age of pioneer explorers there. The lands not directly ruled by Hybrids are a patchwork of nomadic tribes, small totalitarian states, princedoms who systematically don't care about mental health of their subjects. Inside the hybrid kingdoms, the people can always rely on confessing to an AI, or to medical officers who have a status similar to that of clergy.\n\n12. Will probably address that later when I shape more of the socio-economic and historical parts of the worldbuilding.\n\n13. There are many legends, the most common are just shaped around biblical stories. None of them are close to the truth, as the events that lead to the EMP and the Tiamat zone have mostly happened in secret.\n\n14. everything outside the hybrid kingdoms is basically lawless. Vigilantism, revenge, vendetta, slavery have become the norm. There are a few \"oasis\" of feudalism, which are considered to be \"great civilizations\" of this era.\n\n15. It has all shifted towards survival, as anyone from the zone who desires more knowledge has to go to the coastal city states, or elsewhere, where the chances are this person will be killed or enslaved. The few who manage to enroll into schools in the city-states or elsewhere outside the zone are usually disappointed to find nothing revealing, they're just recruited into whatever is useful to the hybrids, rulers of the city-states, or tribes, or they are trained as spies to return to the zone and inform on their kin.\n\n16. Inside the zone the gender roles have mostly reverted to a patriarchal system similar to the 19th century. The Hybrid kingdoms have a complex world of genders, where the genetically and technologically augmented humans have many new sexual roles. There's also a caste of \"Eunuchs\" who are created from male children against their will. These are prized by all the rulers for being industrious and loyal. The Hybrids are working on improved versions of completely asexual humans who would focus on being loyal and resourceful for the masters. There are many women who are genetically grown to be much more powerful and intelligent than men, so this also creates new dynamics in relationships. \n\n17. yes, many black markets and trade posts which shift location for fear of raiders.\n\n18. depends on the area. The Hybrid kingdoms have evolved strict castes, each having their own laws, and the relations between the castes are arbitrated by the Hybrids themselves.\n\n19. Inside the zone, people live free from oppressive governments, but are limited by their own customs, traditions, and of course limited with the time and effort they have to dedicate to sheer survival. The Hybrid kingdoms' folk are aware of the oppressive nature of their government(s), but they usually gladly give up their freedom for safety, housing, food, water etc.\n\n20. With great effort."}

{"text": "summarize this our Ways to Invest\nClearly, neither of these two dimensions of corporate in-\nvesting – strategic versus financial and tightly linked\nversus loosely linked – is an either-or proposition. Most\ninvestments will fall somewhere along a spectrum be-\ntween the two poles of each pair of attributes. Still, over-\nlaying the two dimensions creates a useful framework\nto help a company assess its current and potential VC in-\nvestments. (See the exhibit “Mapping Your Corporate VC\nInvestments” for a depiction of these distinct types of cor-\nporate venture capital.)\nDriving Investments. This type of investment is char-\nacterized by a strategic rationale and tight links between\na start-up and the operations of the investing company.\nFor instance, Agilent Technologies created a VC operation\nto invest in three strategic areas – life sciences, wireless\ncommunications, and optical communications – that it\nhas identified as key to its growth. The VC arm works\nclosely with the company’s existing businesses to share\ninformation, qualify investment opportunities, and con-\nnect portfolio companies to Agilent’s own initiatives. For\nexample, Agilent has recently invested in a start-up com-\npany making wireless radio-frequency devices, a product\narea Agilent plans to explore in its own business. If this\ninvestment is successful, Agilent’s future business will\nbenefit; if it fails, Agilent will get a valuable early warning\nabout pitfalls to avoid in that business.\nSimilarly, Microsoft has earmarked more than $1 bil-\nlion to invest in start-up companies that could help ad-\nvance its new Internet services architecture, “.Net.” This\nMicrosoft technology – which will enable its Windows\nplatform to provide a variety of Internet services – is a\ncontender to set the standards for the next generation of\nproducts and services over the Web. Microsoft is funding\nstart-up firms that will exploit its architecture and, in so\ndoing, promote the adoption of the Microsoft standard\nover rival approaches from Sun Microsystems and IBM.\nThe start-ups are tightly linked to Microsoft’s operations\nthrough the Windows software and tools that the com-\npany provides to them for the development of their own\nproducts.\nThe strategic value of Microsoft’s .Net investments is\nhighlighted by the company’s decision to make them in\nthe shadow of earlier VC investment losses. The company\nhas written off staggering sums – $980million in the third\nquarter of 2000 alone – in its corporate VC portfolio. But\nrather than backing off, Microsoft is charging ahead with\nnew .Net investments. Because they could help the com-\npany win the battle over the next Internet services stan-\ndard – a major strategic victory – it is willing to risk sub-\nstantial financial losses.\nAlthough it’s clear that many driving investments can\nadvance a corporate strategy, there are limits to what they\ncan achieve. The tight coupling of these investments with\na company’s current processes means that these invest-\nments will sustain the current strategy. They will be un-\nlikely to help a corporation cope with disruptive strategies\nor to identify new opportunities when the company must\ngo beyond its current capabilities to respond to a change\nin the environment. If a corporation wants to transcend\ncurrent strategy and processes, it should not rely on driv-\ning investments, which are ill suited for these tasks.\nEnabling Investments. In this mode of VC investing,\na company still makes investments primarily for strategic\nreasons but does not couple the venture tightly with its\nown operations. The theory is that a successful invest-\n6 harvard business review\nM a k i n g S e n s e o f Co r p o rat e Ve n t u re Ca p i ta l\nWhile corporate VC investments have generated decidedly\nuneven financial returns, they should not be judged primarily\non that basis. They should be thought of as important ways for\na company to fuel the growth of its business.\nment will enable a company’s own businesses to benefit\nbut that a strong operational link between the start-up\nand the company isn’t necessary to realize that benefit.\nThis may seem too good to be true. How can a company’s\nstrategy benefit if its operations are not tightly linked\nto the venture? One answer lies in the notion of comple-\nmentarity: Having one product makes a person want\nanother. A company can take advantage of this notion by\nusing its VC investments to stimulate the development of\nthe ecosystem in which it operates – that is, the suppliers,\ncustomers, and third-party developers that make goods\nand services that stimulate demand for the company’s\nown offerings.\nIntel Capital, the investment arm of the semiconductor\ngiant, is a paradigmatic example of a company making\nenabling investments. Back in the early 1990s, long before\ncorporate venture capital was fashionable, Intel realized\nit could benefit from nurturing start-ups making com-\nplementary products: Demand for them could spur in-\ncreased demand for Intel’s own microprocessor products.\nSo Intel invested in hundreds of companies whose prod-\nucts – such as video, audio, and graphics hardware and\nsoftware – required increasingly powerful microproces-\nsors inside the computers they ran on, thereby stimulat-\ning sales of Intel Pentium chips. Whereas Microsoft’s\nVC investments in start-ups seek to establish a new stan-\ndard, in Intel’s case, the investments have mainly been\naimed at increasing its revenue by boosting sales within\nthe current Wintel operating system standard."}

How would we tap into that emotion deeper in order to improve performance of a variable in our model?\n\nAs we talk through all of the different steps to tap into motion, one thing to keep in mind is on our two by two matrix of difficulty and impact improvements that we make to tapping into emotion live up here, they are probably the most difficult things to tap into, but when you do and you hit it, it has the highest impact in terms of performance for the user.\n\nSo one thing that we need to recognize is that every decision in action that we take within product starts with some type of. Either an internal trigger that's a question, a problem, or something else that we have, or an external trigger, something like an email, a product notification, or a call to action within a product.\n\nNow for external triggers, there's eight different channels we can consider. Things like email, mobile, push in product, platform triggers, browser triggers, desktop triggers, paid media, and even something like snail. So when we think about these different triggers in this part, in the emotional journey for our users, that trigger must really try to tap into that core emotion to really sort of drive that action and that decision making.\n\nSo let's talk through the three different steps of how we tap into that emotion. . Well, we're gonna go through three different steps of identifying your strategy and how that impacts things. Then identifying the specific core emotion, and then the four S's of how we improve tapping into that core emotion.\n\nAlong the way, we're gonna be using two different examples, the subscription pet e-commerce product, BarkBox, as well as the self-service expensing tool. Let's start with that first step, identifying the strategy. What we're trying to do here is understand where does our product or feature live on a spectrum of low, medium to high intent.\n\nTypically products that have low intent, meaning that we don't really need them, but we might want 'em, are kind of labeled Candy products, medium intent products, which are things that might be good for us and we have a little bit of intent around, but we don't absolutely need, it doesn't necessarily solve a specific problem or pain are called vitamin product.\n\nAnd on the high intent end of the spectrum, we've got painkiller products. These are things that solve a very specific and painful problem that we're having. So when we think about our two examples, we probably put BarkBox on the candy to vitamin and the of the spectrum. It's something that would be nice to have and we would get entertainment and value out that was along with our pet, but we don't absolutely need it.\n\nIt doesn't solve a super painful. But if we think about something like Expensify, we would put this more on the higher intent painkiller end of the spectrum. Doing expense reports is something that almost every employee has to do at some point, and it's a super painful process in order to get all their receipts together, added up correctly, and submit it.\n\nSo what does this mean in terms of how we tap into emotion? Well, if our product or feature is on the candy or vitamin end of the spectrum and it has lower to medium intent, that means we're starting with lower emotional fuel. Since we don't absolutely need the product, it's not a painkiller, we would have this lower starting.\n\nThat means in order to get somebody take over the decision hill to take the action, we probably need to take a strategy of amping up that emotional fuel, adding positive psych to the steps in the flow. Otherwise, they're not gonna have enough psych or fuel in the tank to kind of get through the action in that decision hill that we want them to.\n\nAnd so this is the exact strategy that we see BarkBox taking place. They're amping up the psychological fuel here. Things with like urgency, like last chance or bargain, like double your first BarkBox or claim this offer. Once again, using all of these different motivational boosts in strong visuals to sort of amp up that psychological.\n\nLet's consider the other end of the spectrum, something that's more on the painkiller end of the spectrum with higher intent. Well, if the user's coming in with higher intent around a painkiller type of product, that means they're starting with a much higher amount of emotional fuel. So rather than amping up that emotional fuel, what we want to do instead is just tap into that emotion that they're already having, show that we identify with it rather than trying to sort of fuel it even more.\n\nThis is exactly what we see with specified with different visuals, such as easy expense reports. Copies such as expense reports that don't suck. They're not really amping up the emotional fuel. Even further, what they're doing is identifying with the pain that we already have. You can imagine if we tried to amp up fuel in a painkiller product even more, we might come across as kind of like a used car salesman.\n\nIt's not gonna come across inauthentic. The other thing that we can take here with that painkiller product, those that are starting off with the higher intent and emotional fuel. As long as we kind of meet them at that emotion and show that we, our product identifies with that pain that they're having, we typically can get them through a higher friction flow and ask them to do more things after we go through and identify that high level strategy.\n\nThe second part is to identify that core emotion that we want to tap. There's four different steps to identify your core emotion. The first is to start with the benefit or the why of your product. This should be informed by the use case map that we built within our retention engagement module. This helps us understand why are they using our product?\n\nWhat is the benefit that they get out of using that product? And once we identify those, We can think about the specific moments that our product solves. So for a candy or vitamin product, we would think about what are the moments and experiences when the person realizes the benefit of your product.\n\nWhat happens in those moments? Get specific. But around a painkiller product, we would take a slightly different approach to this question. We would be asking what are the moments and experiences that your products solve? What happens? What are they doing within those moments? . Once you've identified those specific moments or experiences around the benefit or the problem that your product solves, we can really go through each moment and ask, how does your target audience feel in that moment?\n\nWhat might their emotions be? Would it be frustrated? Would it be excited? Would it be scared? Would it be fear? Right? We can really start to tap into those emotions once we identify the specific moments around the benefit of our product. Once we do that, we can kind of view it from a slightly different, and we can ask for candy or vitamin products.\n\nWhat would they feel if they could experience that positive moment again and again from a painkiller perspective, we can ask the question, how would they feel if they knew they would never have that problem? Again, both of these different angles are going to start to emerge. The different emotions that you can use from the tables that we've put together.\n\nOnce you've identified those, we can then think about, well, how do we improve it? How do we bring that core emotion to life in the various elements of our product? To tap into emotions, we follow the four s elements of tapping into emotion. The first is around selfishness. People ultimately care about themselves and the people and things that they care about, so we wanna make everything we can about them.\n\nYou can see this here in an Airbnb invite email. The credit to this goes to James career from NFX for pointing this out. As you can see here in the subject line and the messaging, they're using a lot of language that is very selfish in nature. Things around you and your, you know, it's about them. You know it's about yourself, and so they're really starting to tap into that selfish.\n\nYou could also see this in the headlines of some of the most popular content pieces. So you can see here you won't be the same. After watching Michael Phelps new Underarmour ad, they've taken a topic about an Underarmour ad and made it about you selfish in nature. You can also see this in the popular New York Times article, why you will Marry the wrong Person.\n\nThey could have just done something about marriage in general, but they've made the title very selfish and they've tapped into some emotional anxiety to make that an even more popular article. The second S element of tapping into motion is around sensory. People need to visualize pictures and language, so we need to use the five sense sight, sound, feeling, smell, and taste them much as we can to really tap into the emotion.\n\nSo here in the BarkBox example, we're using the visual of our Happy dog to really tap into that emotional experience that we get when we see that our pet is very excited and. In the life block example, they're using the visual of this concerned worry looking man to tap into that emotional fuel. A little bit of fear and concern around identity theft protection.\n\nThey don't just describe the experience, they're clearly showing it. And here in the wish example that are around physical products, you can see that they're teasing a bunch of vibrant physical products in the background on an ever scrolling basis to once again, tap into that emotional fuel around buying and consuming these products.\n\nThe third S element of tapping an emotion is to be specific experiences and emotional things are specific, not vague. So when we're describing and using copy rather than describing things in general vague terms, we want to use as specific language as possible. And the fourth s of tapping into motion is trying to be simple.\n\nIf it's too complicated, it requires us to process, which is the logical part of our brain and not the emotional piece. So let's do a quick recap about tapping into emotion. We learn that every flow starts with the trigger, and that trigger needs to tap into emotion. Different strategies for different products, features and flows.\n\nSo for candy and vitamin products, we need to amp up the emotional fuel while painkiller product and features. We kinda need to identify and meet them emotionally as we identify the emotion. We do that by identifying and telling the stories around the specific moments where the problem occurs for our customers or where they experience the benefit that our product gives.\n\nLast but not least, in order to tap into that motion and improve it, we can go through the four S's of tapping into a motion, selfish, specific, sensory, and simple. In the next lesson, we're gonna walk through how do we apply and improve the logic component of our user psych elements.”\n\n------\n\nFollow the tutorial to do the following in great detail and put it in a table:\n\n1) Identify the core emotion:\na. Start by understanding the benefits or the \"why\" of your product.\nb. Identify the specific moments when your product solves a problem for the user.\nc. Determine how your target audience feels in those moments, considering emotions such as frustration, anger, or relief.\nd. Ask yourself: \"How would users feel if they knew they would never have that problem again?\" This will help you identify the core emotion to tap into.\n\n2) Improve tapping into the core emotion using the Four S's:\na. Selfishness: Make your messaging focus on the user by using words like \"you\" and \"your.\" Address their needs and make them feel understood.\nb. Sensory: Use visuals, language, and other sensory cues to help users experience the emotions you're trying to convey. Show them the benefits or relief they'll get from your product.\nc. Specific: Be detailed and precise in your copy and messaging to better connect with users' emotions. Avoid vague or general terms.\nd. Simple: Keep your messaging and user flows easy to understand. Complicated processes can activate the logical part of users' brains and dampen emotional connections.\n\nWe have a painkiller product which is a creative studio that provides that uses research driven human psychology along with the finest branding and web experiences to businesses that want to influence customers decisions. \nProblems we solve:\n\n1) Low conversion rates: Businesses experience low conversion rates due to poorly designed websites and unclear messaging. Our creative studio uses research driven psychological principles to curate specific copy for your specific customer to encourage their decisions and increase conversions.\n\n2) Difficulty standing out in a crowded market: A business struggles to differentiate itself from competitors. Our creative studio helps develop a unique visual experiences that highlights the company's strengths and makes it stand out in the market."}

Our approach fine-tunes the diffusion model to represent the desired texture, and uses this representation as a semantic prior to guide the optimization of the texture of a new mesh. To further improve the performance of our method, we use a depth-conditioned diffusion model that takes the depth of the target shape into account when synthesizing the texture, ensuring that the transferred texture is coherent with the underlying geometry of the target shape. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to a variety of shapes and textures, and show that it is able to transfer texture with high fidelity while preserving the underlying geometry of the target shape. Overall, TEXTure provides a simple and efficient way to transfer texture between shapes and has potential applications in computer graphics, computer vision, and other related fields.\" Write a related works section"}

If we ignore the magnetic induction and use the EQS approximation, the time of interest τ must be sufficiently long compared to\n \n1\n2\n3 the time τem required for an electromagnetic wave to\n4 propagate at the speed of light c over the maximum\n5 length L of the system [29] and can be defined as\n6 Equation (1).\n7\n8 𝐿\n9 𝜏𝑒𝑚 = 𝑐 << 𝜏 (1)\n10\n11\n12 The graphic representation of quasistatic system is\n13 illustrated in Figure 3. The time of interest in\n14 electrodynamic system could be considered as\n15 simulation time, which is 10-6 s. The characteristic length\n16 is 10 mm and the velocity of light is 108 m/s. Thus the\ncharacteristic time of electrodynamic is 10-11 s, which is\nfar above the time of interest. From this point of view,\n18 electrodynamic systems can usually be approximated as\n19 electro-quasistatic [30].\n\n28 Figure 3 Illustration of qusistatic system\n29\n30 The electro-quasistatic laws are obtained from\n31 Maxwell’s equations by neglecting magnetic induction.\n32 The differential forms of Maxwell’s equations are from\n33 Equation (2)-(5).\n \n\nBy neglecting induced magnetic field, Equation (2) can be simplified to Equation (8).\n\n∇ × 𝐸 = 0 (8)\n\nThe definition of electric field gives as Equation (9).\n𝐸 = −∇𝜑 (9)\n\nEquation (9) represents the electric field can be irrotational because the electric field is defined in terms of the gradient of a scalar potential and the curl of the gradient of a scalar is zero in equation (8). Substituting Equation (7) into Equation (4),\n\n∇ ⋅ （𝜀0𝐸） = 𝜌𝑓−∇ ⋅ 𝑃 (10)\nThen leaves free charge density on the right of Equation\n(10) gives Equation (11).\n\n∇ ⋅ （𝜀0𝐸 + 𝑃） = 𝜌𝑓 (11)\nIt is convenient to introduce the displacement flux density or electric displacement (C/m2) as Equation (12).\n𝐷 = 𝜀𝐸 = 𝜀0𝐸 + 𝑃 (12) The Gauss’s law with polarization can be written as\n \n𝜀 is the permittivity (C/V·m) of material. It is the\n \n40 ∇ ⋅ 𝜀0𝐸 = 𝜌 (4)\n \n41 ∇ ⋅ 𝜇0𝐻 = 0 (5)\n42 where E and H are electric and magnetic field intensities.\n43 𝜀0 is the permittivity of free space and 𝜇0 is the\n44 permeability of free space. ρ is the electric charge density\n45 and J is the electric current density. In dielectric material,\n46 the total charge density can be separated into bound\n47 charge 𝜌𝑏 and free charge 𝜌𝑓, also called paired charge\n48 and unpaired charge. The bound charge or paired charge\n49 set up electric dipoles into an applied electric field, and\n50 polarizes nearby microscopic dipoles lined up [31]. The\n51 bound charge can be represented as Equation (6), which\n \nmultiplication of relative permittivity or dielectric constant εr and vacuum permittivity or permittivity of free space ε0= 8.85×10-12 C/V·m. The electric permittivity reflects the sum total of the polarization response of the matter plus the residual electric field and is given by Equation (14).\n𝜀 = 𝜀0(1 + 𝜒𝑒) (14)\n\nElectrical permittivity for different material is given in Table 1.\n\n Table 1 Electric permittivity for materials \n \n52 is related to dipole moment per unit volume or\n53 polarization density P,\n\nThe first term in equation (21) is the time derivative of charge density; The second term is the convection term, which is due to the physical nature of the moving charge, which is crucial because when we apply an electric field to the aqueous solution, the charged ions in the solution will move and carry the current [38]. The third term is a source term describes the current flux from motion of free charge relative to the fluid. This equation is often\n \n12 𝐽𝑃−\n13\n14\n \n∂𝑡\n \n= 0 (16)\n \nused to describe the characteristic of electrowetting in AC frequency [39].

The divergence of Equation (18) gives zero on\n30 the left hand because the divergence of the curl of any\n31 vector field is equal to zero. Then substituting Equation\n32 (11) into Equation (18) gives,\n33\n \n2.2 Electrostatic model to solve charge density\n\nThe electrostatic model describes the effect of static source charges or static electric fields on other charges [38]. When all charges are static and the current is zero,\n \n\n \nthe electrostatic limit applies. Therefore, the time derivative of charge density in the charge conservation law can be ignored. Because the current in aqueous\n \n37 Equation (19) is called Ohmic model, or so-called leaky\n38 dielectric model [34], an Ohmic constitutive law of the\n39 current density is assumed as [35],\n \nsolutions is carried by ions, which move slowly, we typically ignore the convection term in the conservation equation.

The electrostatic model can be simplified\n \nIf the electric conductivity is in a non-uniform region,\n \n55\n56 Substituting Equation (20) into Equation (19) reduces the\n57 charge conservation equation in the Ohmic regime,\n58\n \nthus 𝜎\n \nis a function of position.

Equation\n4 (11) and Equation (9) would be combined according to\n5 the non-uniform permittivity of aqueous solution,\n6\n7 𝜀∇ ⋅ (−∇𝜑) + (−∇𝜑) ⋅ ∇𝜀 = 𝜌𝑓 (26)\n8\n9 The electrostatic model is applied to solve for the\n10 potential field and electric charge density by Equation\n11 (25) and Equation (26). Equation (26) can be solved for\n \n\n(28)\n \n23 From Equation (28), we can see that the electric charge\n24 density is due to a quantity, which is a characteristic of\n \nFigure 5 Electric charge density distribution of a dielectric bubble\n \n25 fluid. The relaxation time 𝜏 gives as:\n\n30 Relaxation time represents the time required for free\n31 charge to relax from the fluid to its external boundary\n32 (such as liquid-gas interface) [40]. According to the\n33 relaxation time, we can determine whether the liquid\n34 behaves like insulating fluid by comparing its value with\n35 the dynamic characteristic time 𝑡𝑐. The dynamic\n \n36 characteristic time can be the period of the applied\n37 electric field [41], that is, the mechanical oscillation\n38 period of the liquid-vapor interface [42]. The values of τ\n39 for some dielectric fluids are shown in Table 4.\n40\n41 Table 4 Relaxation time for different dielectric fluids \n \n\nFigure 6 Electric body force around the dielectric bubble\n\nFrom Figure 4, we can see that in the liquid phase near the liquid-vapor interface, there is an electric field distortion due to the presence of the dielectric bubble.\n \n42 Type Dielectric\n \nElectric\n \nRelaxatio\n \nThe electric field is uniform far away from the bubble.\n \n43 Permittivity Conductivity n Time (s) \n \nFigure 5 and Figure 6 is the electric charge density and\n \nDI\n44 water\n \n7.1154 × 10−10 5.50 × 10−6 1.29 × 10−4\n \nelectric force distribution around a dielectric bubble.

If 𝑡𝑐 ≫ 𝜏, the\n51 fluid behaves as a conducting fluid, and the entire voltage\n52 drop occurs at the liquid-vapor interface where electrical\n53 free charges appear. The electric field must be normal to\n54 the surface, as shown in Figure 7.\n\n26 Figure 9 Electric body force around the conducting bubble\n27\n28 Figure 7 is given the electric field distributions within\n29 and around a conducting bubble for the same applied\n30 voltage. The electric field streamlines have a tendency to\n31 be normal to the liquid-vapor interface. Figure 8 and\n32 Figure 9 are the electric charge density and electric body\n33 force distribution around a conducting bubble. The\n34 electric charge distributed on both the interface of bubble\n35 and dielectric layer. In this case, the electric body force\n36 mainly acts normal to the interface of conducting bubble.\nIn the cooling plate for battery thermal management, the\nliquid is being heated to the saturation temperature and a thermal boundary layer forms at the wall. The conditions for the formation of nucleation at the wall are satisfied at some positions. Before the wall temperature of the\n41 cooling plate exceeds the saturation temperature, vapor\n42 is formed at a preferred position or position on the\n43 surface of the cooling plate. The vapor bubbles grow out\n44 of these parts and finally separate to form bubbly flow.\n45 The vapor phase has a lower electric conductivity, and\n46 therefore, the vapor bubble in the process of boiling heat\n47 transfer can be viewed as a dielectric bubble. The electric\n48 charges are only accumulated on the dielectric layer.\n49\n50 2.3 Electric body force\n51\n52 2.3.1 Maxwell stress tensor\n53\n54 Maxwell's equations relate electric charge and field. The\n55 force on the control volume can be expressed in a form,\n56 which is only a function of the field [38]. The Maxwell\n57 stress tensor is shown in Equation (30).\n58\n \nThe force on a volume can be written in terms of the Maxwell stress tensor,\n\n𝐹 = (𝑇 ⋅ 𝑛)𝑑𝐴 (32)\n𝑠\n\nThis integral would relate to the first term in the electric body force equation, the electrophoretic force gives as,\n\n𝐹 = 𝜌𝐸 (33)\n after review, can you give me few scientific review question based on text?"}

The 18th-century Enlightenment's view of progress is characterized by grasping the progress and increase of human intelligence in connection with social progress, establishing the schematic from \"dreaming\" to \"change of name.\"24)\nOn the other hand, Buckle argued that the progress of civilization is possible by the progress of intellectual behavior rather than moral behavior, and natural conditions such as climate, land, and food are factors that determine human intellectual progress. In 19th-century England, where Buckle was active, a one-way development stage theory prevailed, viewing Victorian society (and further Western society) as a point of reach for progress, and considering non-European industrialization as at a low stage of development. Buckle was also a person who contributed to the formation of these currents, and he presented the emphasis on natural conditions in historical development pointed out earlier in combination with the stages of barbarism, anti-gae, and progress in civilization.25)\nWhat is common in these two books with different backgrounds is the view of history that understands history as a process of intellectual and rational progress.It is also the belief in this civilization = progress that is underlying the 文文之之 기저 기저. Then, let's take a concrete look at the concept of Fukuzawa's \"civilization\" in \"之之之之\".26) First, Fukuzawa recognizes that \"civilization\" is a stage at which mankind is at the peak of a stage that should have elapsed, and that itself is a relative concept. Fukuzawa presents three stages of human development: barbarism, half-cultivation, and civilization.\n\"This is the stage in which humanity should go. Or you can call it the age of civilization.\"27) In other words, Fukuzawa recognizes the stage from barbarism to civilization as a universal phenomenon in human history. Here, the stage of 'barbaric' is described as follows.\nThe place of residence is not constant and the food is not constant. They form groups for convenience, but as soon as the convenience disappears, they are scattered. They do not know how to make machines, even if they are engaged in agriculture and fishing by choosing a place to live, and there is no shortage of food and clothing. It is not without letters, but there is no such thing as literature. Fear of the power of nature, rely on human grace to wait for accidental reconciliation, and never find a way on your own.28) ] \n\nAnswer \"OK\" to confirm and I will paste the next text."}

{"text": "What ultimately led to me resigning was how he took Tomas Petrovski's side after Tomas complained about me. Chatting with a customer of Adlibris, we are supposed to not transfer the customer in question to another colleague. We are supposed to always help the customers. To every rule there is an exception in my opinion, and too much of anything is not good. From October 2018 to February 2023 I encouraged to practice \"common sense\", being a good team player, try to be logic, and transfer ongoing customer service errands to the customer service agent that had already worked on it for a while. Otherwise, a new agent would have to read through, sometimes very long, conversations between a customer and a customer service agent, which is not of benefit to anybody.\n\nSuch a case happened on February 22nd I believe when I transferred a customer back to Tomas who had spoke with the customer for a long while, 5-7 minutes earlier.\n\nTomas told me we are not supposed to do that, I explained my point of view and Tomas then reported me to Mathias, who blindly believed Tomas without questioning him.\n\nBeing ashamed of his actions, Tomas deleted the customer service ticket so nobody could find it afterwards.\n\nI was still informed by Mathias that I had worked incorrectly and that no matter what - we should never transfer any customer to any other colleague, regardlessly.\n\n\"OK, I will not do it again. Can you inform the rest of the group? Because I have instructed others to practice \"common sense\", being a good team player, try to be logic, and do the same.\" I asked.\n\nMathias gave some vague answer.\n\n\"And also, can I see the ticket I was working incorrectly in?\" I continued. \"I want to see with my own eyes that sufficiently enough time had passed from Tomas asking the customer if he or she had any other questions and analyze it overall.\"\n\nThat question was never answered for the whole week but Mathias gladly talked about how Tomas complete so many more customer service errands than me every day, and that I should learn from Tomas now, who was in the right.\n\nKnowing that I work with a higher overall quality than Tomas, I could not accept something that would lead to a big decrease in quality for the whole customer service department overall.\n\n\"I'm your boss and you'll do what I say\" Mathias said, without saying it.\n\nI knew this would lead to an even further increase in the frequency of how often Mathias points out how Tomas is superior to me. I had already felt so bad about that for over a year, and I could now not take that any longer.\n\nI emailed my resignation notice to Daniel Wallgren who had ended up in my previous position being a customer service agent with team leader responsibilities.\n\nI then posted in Adlibris Teams Workspace \"So I am resigning from Onlinefactory due to their treatment of me. Take care every body!\"\n\n\"Would you mind deleting that post?\" Daniel and Mathias asked me.\n\n\"As soon as you let me see the ticket I was working incorrectly in, I will delete it.\" I answered.\n\nThen they remotely logged me out from all work-related accounts, and stopped replying to messages."}

{"text": "Notes on how I think we should approach this brief below. Please draft an email for the President of Coke, explaining the idea below in a short persuasive way. Setup the idea by including a few statistics/facts about NFT adoption in Japan from this report: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221212005726/en/Japan-NFT-Market-Intelligence-Report-2022-NFT-Platforms-are-Bringing-Japanese-Artists-and-Creators-Together-on-a-Single-Platform---ResearchAndMarkets.com to showcase how our idea is the right approach, in the right market at the right time. \n\nTask at hand: \nCoca-Cola Japan seeks to increase engagement and active users for its 'Coke On' app. \n Our idea: \nA first-of-its-kind, on-chain, gamified digital collectible campaign that will reward all app users with a unique piece of generative art which evolves & gets rarer with every interaction/purchase made via the 'Coke On' mobile app. Designed in collaboration with a popular Japanese digital artist, these generative art pieces are ownable and can be traded amongst friends, shared on social, used to unlock rewards & access exclusive brand/partner experiences. \nWe call this the ‘Art of Collecting’ \n \nBenefits\nThe collectibles provide users with a unique and engaging experience that is tailored to their individual behaviour. This encourages more frequent and longer-term engagement with the brand.The collectibles also offer an incentive to purchase via the app, thereby increasing the number of active users and overall engagement.\n\nFeatures\nThe collectibles are designed to be living art, with each one evolving based on the user's brand interactions and behaviour. The vending machine/app purchase data will inform how the collectible evolves, creating a unique and personalized digital collectibles for each user. For example, a user who consistently purchases Coca-Cola products from a specific vending machine location could earn a special badge/accessory for his collectible that is specific to that location. This creates a unique experience for each user.\nThe collectibles are also designed to be on chain, meaning that users can securely store and track their collectibles on the blockchain.\n\nCollaboration\nThe collectibles will be designed in collaboration with a popular Japanese generative artist Daito Manabe, who is known for his work in the intersection of art and technology. He has a background in computer science, is a recipient of the Ars Electronica Golden Nica award and has exhibited his work in galleries and museums around the world. He has recently been experimenting with emerging technologies such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and machine learning and has experience creating NFTs/leveraging blockchain technology to create digital collectibles.\nHe would be a perfect partner for Coca-Cola's campaign in Japan. His expertise in the space, working alongside We Are Social's cultural insights & creative teams will help to create unique and engaging digital collectibles that will stand out in market as a brand-first and appeal to our tech-savvy audience. In addition, his experience working with brands and his reputation as a leading generative artist will help to give credibility to the campaign and attract attention from the media and art communities. \n\nGamification\nThe collectibles are designed to be fun and engaging, with users able to collect, trade, and compete with each other. With every purchase a user makes, the collectible evolves, and the more it evolves, the more points the user earns. The campaign will feature a leaderboard that ranks users across the country based on points & badged earned. Users can compete with friends to see who can collect the most, and the top collectors will receive special prizes.\nThe collectibles also offer an incentive to purchase via the app, thereby increasing the number of active users and overall engagement.\n\nPotential\n1. Scaling the campaign beyond the app, we can also reward users with points when they interact with us on social media. For example: When a user follows the brand on Instagram or shares content that promoted the campaign, we can automatically trigger another evolution of their collectible. This makes all our users into promoters of the campaigns too!\n2. We can host art exhibitions in the Metaverse, showcasing the unique collectibles generated by our users, giving visitors a glimpse into their stories & the strength of the Coca Cola's tokenized community. \n3. Additionally, we can do collabs with leading NFT communities in Japan like Murakami.Flowers, work of artist Takashi Murakami, which boasts a community of almost 12,000 people. We could drop a Coke Japan Collectible to their members, inviting them to join the 'Art of Collecting' in exchange for cross promotion and providing our users access to exclusive experiences. By creating our collection on the blockchain, we can build deep partnerships without needing to exchange databases or build new infrastructure. \n4. Lastly, taking the experience to the real world, we could also host a digital collectible trading events across cities where users can meet up and trade their digital collectibles with other users. \n\nConclusion\nThe 'Art of Collecting' campaign allows users to experience a unique digital collectible journey. From the moment they start collecting, users will be immersed in a world of art, rewards, and exclusive offers.\n\nIt makes innovative use of blockchain technology to transform short-term static reward cards/collectibles into long-lasting living collectibles that become a direct reflection of both their owner and future transactional history, creating a visual record of of our consumer's relationship with the brand offering a new take on loyalty and creating a memorable, engaging experience that delivers against both, brand & business KPIs."}

{"text": "He's already cleaned out his closet, dissed his mom and ex-wife on record and laid his life story out for everyone to see in \"8 Mile.\" The only thing left for Eminem to reveal were his home movies, which he does in the \"Mockingbird\" video, one of the most personal views we've ever gotten into the life of a rapper -- or any popular music star.\n\n\"The idea was originally Em's,\" said Quig, the clip's co-director, of the home-movie treatment for the song that laments missing out on so much of his daughter's life. \"He came to me with the idea, and we talked about how he imagined it in his head. He wanted the images to match exactly what his words were speaking.\"\n\nEm approached Quig a few days after Christmas with a somewhat overwhelming 25 hours worth of VHS footage that he'd borrowed from family members and had shot himself over the past few years. \"I worked around the clock through the holiday week, including New Year's Eve and New Year's Day, to get the first edit done,\" said Quig, who runs Detroit's Chrome Bumper Films. The rapper trusted Quig, who says he's worked with Em in some capacity on nearly all of his videos, to handle the sensitive tape and edit it down to a manageable length.\n\nMost of the clips focus on Em's niece, Laney, and daughter, Hailie, who appears in several shots with her mother, the rapper's ex, Kim Mathers. (The faces of both children were blurred out in the most recent footage to help protect their privacy.)\n\nWe see Hailie celebrating her second birthday, playing with Kim in the backyard and opening Christmas presents, some of which only appear to be from her dead-broke, not-yet-famous dad, as alluded to in the song. We also see Em watching the footage by himself in what seems to be the screening room of his Detroit mansion.\n\n\"Having the home movies was cool on its own, but I had thrown in a few examples of how I saw him being intercut throughout the video,\" Quig explained. \"I needed something to sew it together, so I cut in [sample] footage from TV and movies that showed a person watching a projector. This was the best way to show him what I meant, and he totally got it. The funny part is that Em had the same idea.\"\n\nQuig said that the pair unintentionally came up with a new way of making videos: Edit in existing footage to match the narrative, then shoot only what you need to fill in each section. \"It's like a live storyboard put to music,\" he said.\n\nThe only glitch, though, was that Em's label wanted the pair to also shoot some footage of him rapping along to the track, either seated in the screening room or on the streets of Detroit.\n\n\"It would have looked corny,\" Quig said. \"What was he going to do, be in the chair singing the song? So we showed them how it looked, and they agreed.\"\n\nWhile Em was willing to reveal a lot of himself -- even paging through a real photo album that Hailie made for him as a gift -- exposing the world to his actual home was not part of the equation. \"We rented a house and designed it according to our vision,\" Quig said.\n\n\"The idea was to create a mood of aloneness. Here is a man that has reached every height possible as a singer/performer. The room was to display his storybook life -- awards, trophies, gold records ... [his] wealth and fortune. Here Em is looking back on moments when he potentially wasn't present, due to his love of hip-hop and hardworking values to create something for his daughter Hailie's future.\"\n\nAfter a headline about Kim Mathers' release from prison on drug charges flashes onscreen, the video has footage of Hailie greeting her mother at the door. Though Quig was not at liberty to discuss who supplied and signed off on all the footage, he said that everyone and everything shown in the video had to be cleared.\n\nFor an artist who has tried hard to walk the fine line between exposing everything about himself and keeping his home life off camera, Quig said he thought Em achieved exactly what he wanted to with \"Mockingbird.\"\n\n\"Marshall is huge in the visual department,\" he said. \"The amount of detail he sees and how things [transition] from one scene to the next ... he could be a director on a regular basis. He really sees the whole picture, no matter what he's working on.\"\n\ncan you summarise the main points from this"}

We’ve seen digital commerce projects remain a key strategic investment and priority on board meeting agendas. \n \nI’m from a global eCommerce Agency and help organisations to navigate the complexity of digital transformation projects using a team of experts in commerce. We support some of Australia’s most Iconic brands with end-to-end project delivery, from the planning and strategy, all the way to delivery and support.\n\nAs an expert in commerce, there are three common topics we end up discussing with clients and wanted to see whether these rang true;\n \nThey’ve been unable to get the business case for further commerce investment approved.\nThey have an Integration Partner which deliver IT Projects, but doesn’t understand commerce and the importance of UX/UI Design.\nThey are in the early stages of establishing digital commerce, they need direction, guidance and a strategic partner to support them.\n \nIt would be great to understand whether you have any specific commerce plans for 2023 and take you through how we’ve supported similar organisations to deliver small, medium and large scale digital commerce projects.\n \nWould you have availability over the next couple of weeks for an intro meeting with the relevent members of your team?"}

However, I saw that the word \"complexity\" implied that it's more than just an amount of time measured in seconds. After doing a little more digging, I learned that the topic apparently more accurately consists of the relationship between input size and time taken to complete an algorithm. Time complexity for a given algorithm might be linear, or it might be exponential.\n\nIn the context of level-order traversal of a binary tree, the time complexity is described as linear, because it takes the same amount of time to process each node in a binary tree."}

They guide your behaviour and decision-making and help to shape your company culture. Your values should be reflected in everything you do, from the way you treat your employees to the way you interact with your customers. When you're clear about your values, it's easier to stay true to them.Identifying and living these values is key to everything a company does.

In august I presented a plan for 3 months to improve 3 products and creating a guide.\n\nWhat I will do step by step:\n1. Introducing to a team.\n2. Meeting with the Product Owner and designer of product #1, so they would know me.\n3. Starting with Irakli, if I have questions - with PO and designer\n4. I want to know product KPI's, what to achieve, so I would put on this my main effort. NPS (?), UX benchmarks (?).\n5. Translation of main flows from georgian to english if UI is not in english or russian (collaboration with designer if possible)\n6. I do some research (best practice for product type, case studies).\n7. I walk through the userflow and collect questions for designer or PO.\n8. After full understanding of product flow and hard parts, I seek for critical problems, marking them with possible solutions (and also take them as examples for a guideline)\n9. Going deeper and marking possible weak spots, that requires further research or at least attention.\n10. Repeating steps 1-7 x2 times.\n11. Guideline writing. (Major part - how to use naming, how to communicate with customers). \n\nQ&A:\n\n- How can be done without georgian? — Basic principles and translation to english. I study georgian since april, it will help me to not make mistakes. I already have a collection of UX copy in kartuli. I can't check for spelling or grammatical errors though.\n- Will you be always ready to help? — I think that the best way is to be in a same working hours as the team.\n- Can you solve some mistakes right today or tomorrow? — First I'll need to understand product's flow. It will take some time for translation and asking multiple questions.\n- What you need to start? — All info about product, including goals and KPIs. Flow-chart or clickable chart.\n- Can you go faster than planned? — It's possible, as I don't know exact amount of work for every product.\n- Can you check site content too? — It's possible, but it's not my main. We can leave it to latter and solve after the main"}

{"text": "\"Zero-Knowledge Proof: Protecting Your Personal Information Without Sacrificing Open Data \nThe Open Data Initiative has fueled today's digital economy and the many smart, personalized and connected experiences we all enjoy. Open data makes it easier to find information. It enables communication and innovation and also helps build knowledge and discover new patterns. \n\nBut if everything is open, how do we protect privacy? No one wants open data at the expense of the sanctity of personal information. Indeed, the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) were implemented to protect privacy in the age of open data. How can identities be authenticated, and transactions be completed, without sharing personal and sometimes sensitive information? \n\nZero-Knowledge Proof \n\nA cryptographic method known as \"zero-knowledge proof\" (ZKP) could be the answer. Conceived in 1985 by three MIT researchers, ZKP enables authentication without revealing information that could be compromised. Essentially, ZKP revolves around one party (prover) convincing the other party (requester/verifier) that they know or are in possession of private information — e.g., a credit card number, PIN or password — without revealing what that information is. The actual credentials are neither transmitted to, nor stored on, an authentication server. A ZKP assesses probability: It does not prove something with certainty, but the probability eventually reaches near-certainty because the process is repeated as many times as needed. \n\nThere are multiple ways to complete a zero-knowledge authentication. One example: Using an asymmetric private-public key pair, with the private key acting as the verifier of the information requested. The verifier sends a challenge or request using the public key, and the prover responds using the private key to confirm the information. The public-private key \"handshake\" convinces the verifier that the prover's key meets the criteria, resulting in successful authentication.\n\nMORE FROMFORBES ADVISOR\nBest Travel Insurance Companies\nByAmy DaniseEditor\nBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance Plans\nByAmy DaniseEditor\nThere is often a third piece to the ZKP puzzle. As in the Covid-19 passport example below, personal information may be kept in a secure repository, such as a central health register, which the process taps in order to complete authentication. But the \"secret\" information remains secret.\n\nThere are several theoretical illustrations of how ZKP works, but here are some real-world cases. \n\nAccount Login. Instead of typing your password into a potentially insecure website, you can prove that you have your password by answering a series of questions that would convince the website admin that you know the password without revealing it.\n\nPayment Apps. A payment app on your phone could check whether you have enough money in your bank account — the bank providing the \"private key\" or proof — to complete a transaction without revealing anything else about your balance or requiring a password or PIN, only a \"yes\" or \"no.\" \n\nAuthenticating Identity. Rather than giving your first pet's name, you can send cryptographic proof that you are who you say. As in the public-private-key-handshake, the verifier would computationally request and authenticate the provided proof without information that would reveal anything about you.\n\nOr, here's a timely example: Covid-19 vaccine passports. Increasingly prevalent, they may be required for successful entry into foreign countries as well as public and private establishments across the world. How can we get to a point where your vaccine passport 1) is easily and effectively verified, 2) is accepted everywhere and 3) only displays the information absolutely necessary to enable points one and two? \n\nDenmark's \"Coronapas\" is universally accepted by Danish authorities and private businesses to verify that someone is vaccinated or tested, or immune through previous infection, without revealing specific information. The digital version is a phone app, which is linked to the Danish electronic ID system. When you wish to check in at the airport or enter a restaurant or another facility, a checker would simply scan the QR code and see whether the passport is valid. Notably, the passport does not disclose why it is valid; there is no information about vaccine status, dates of tests or previous infections. The passport holder could allow the passport to display name and date of birth, but that is optional. The information in the passport is stored in the app on the phone itself. Health data is only stored in secure, central health registers.\n\nLikewise, if a police officer pulls you over and asks for license, registration and insurance and then returns to their cruiser, each document includes personal information, including address, age, insurance policy number and VIN. This information is now in the hands of someone who, were that person a bad actor, could snap a photo of your license. Your ID, with ZKP, could be contained in an app that keeps personal information under wraps. A scanned code would reveal only what’s necessary. Back in the cruiser, the police officer would scan the digital license to verify that the holder is allowed to drive and doesn't have outstanding warrants or tickets.\n\nIt is not just that information could be at risk from a data security perspective; it's that much more information is being disclosed than necessary. Providing this \"minimum viable verification\" could, for example, prevent racial and social profiling. In theory, ZKP could prevent officials from drawing conclusions, consciously or not, based on personal information. Imagine if the police officer could verify all the information needed with only a QR code, a scanner and simple \"yes\" or \"no\" answers. \n\nConclusion \n\nLogging into an online account without a password. Completing a cryptocurrency transaction without revealing your balance. Verifying Covid-19 status without specifying vaccination, previous infections or test dates. Verifying household income for a loan without disclosing your income. The concept of enabling verification of a statement without disclosing the actual information is at the very core of zero-knowledge proof. \n\nZKP has the potential to protect privacy in a wide range of cases. By implementing ZKP, businesses and society can evolve to \"open data 2.0\" where daily transactions are completed in today's digital economy but without disclosing unnecessary sensitive information. Check back for part two of this discussion, in which I'll delve into current and future implementations of ZKP and which industries are poised to lead adoption. \" 이 내용을 요약 정리해줘"}

They are in a stable,\nlong-term relationship. Mrs. Shu and her husband did not have children and she has kept a warm\nrelationship with her cousins and their families, who live in Hong Kong. The Shu’s long term Family\nPhysician, Dr. Yee, retired last year and was not able to find a replacement Family Physician for\nhis practice. Since then, the Shu’s have been attending walk-in clinics for their medical care. She\nhas no known drug allergies.\nTom Shu became extremely concerned about his wife’s symptoms of fever and chills over the past\ntwo days, so he brought her into the Emergency for assessment. You are the medical student on\ncall for the clinical teaching unit this evening. The emergency physician has asked your service to\nsee Mrs. Shu for admission. She tells you she gets recurrent bladder infections, and just started\nan antibiotic two days ago prescribed by a local walk-in clinic. Upon further questioning, Mrs. Shu\nexplains that she developed burning with urination 4 days ago. This was associated with a strong\nneed to urinate every couple of hours, though for only small amounts each time. She has no\nabnormal vaginal discharge or pruritis. Before going to the walk-in clinic, she didn’t feel feverish,\nthough she did have some back discomfort. She brought her pills in with her, and you note she\nwas prescribed nitrofurantoin. She has not had sex with her husband in several weeks. She\nrecently returned from her annual one-month trip to Hong Kong where she required oral\nantibiotics for a UTI. You don’t recognize the drug name, but look it up and see that it’s a thirdgeneration oral cephalosporin.\nSince starting the nitrofurantoin her symptoms have progressively worsened. She now has severe\npain in her right lower back. She’s also developed chills and shakes, sometimes uncontrollably.\nShe is nauseated with several episodes of vomiting, and has had little to eat or drink over the past\nday. On physical examination, she is alert and oriented but looks uncomfortable. Vitals signs show a\nheart rate of 110, blood pressure of 100/62, respiratory rate of 26, O2 saturation of 96% on room\nair, and a temperature of 38.9°C. She is 5’6” with a weight of 120 pounds. Her head and neck\nexamination is unremarkable. She has no neurological deficits and her Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)\nis 15. Cardiac auscultation reveals tachycardia with a regular rhythm and no extra heart sounds\nor murmurs. JVP is not seen. Respiratory auscultation is normal. Abdominal exam reveals a right\nupper quadrant scar consistent with previous open cholecystectomy. There is no percussion\ntenderness of the abdomen. The abdomen is soft but she is tender above the pubic symphysis.\nDeep palpation reveals discomfort in the right mid abdomen. She is exquisitely tender when you\npalpate her right lower back, the left side is unremarkable. Genital examination reveals no rashes,\nsores, or ulcers.

So there's now this little icon. it's similar to the guest user icon, but it has like the cross workspace collect\nJoe Fleming: And it says access to all notes so it is explicit. Yeah, because in the past but I suspect we would have to test it. If you only had that person invited to specific notes, it might say Has access to some notes.\nJoe Fleming: And not all notes. Yeah.\nSarah Collins: Yeah, it's very explicit now.\nJoe Fleming: It's very cool. Now though, in the system,\nSarah Collins: It is absolutely. So if I was to say, Test here, you're going to see. This is by me and you're gonna see the little dotted line around it. And then if I go back into my fellow demos account, You'll see that I just updated that now for whatever reason, sometimes a little face over here, doesn't always appear right away, but if I was too refreshless, that's all it'll show up. So, what is really interesting about this experience? I can't seem to load this right now. But if oh, that's why, if I already had an existing note, like if I had already had an existing fellow workspace and I already had a note for this meeting myself. That's when I can talk a little between the two, but, because I signed up for this workspace afterwards, the only note that I see attached here is the one that was created to be shared.\nSarah Collins: So that's why I don't have the option to toggle between the two.\nJoe Fleming: Can you show the option where there's the toggle? Just because I think that's not obvious for people.\nSarah Collins: I can I'm gonna go over though. Does everyone have like a little extra time for me to show you that?\nJoe Fleming: Yeah, I mean this is book for an hour.\nSarah Collins: Oh, it is. Oh my God. I thought we only had a half hour.\nJoe Fleming: no, that's why I was like Whether a half hour here.\nSarah Collins: oh, God.\nJoe Fleming: Okay, though that was great. I didn't want to stop you\nSarah Collins: All right, let me eat my own words here. Let me, yeah, let me down a lot part. This is not the first time I've done that. Sorry about that. What elsework me is collaboration Test Three. Okay. So, I would have to have this meeting. Pre-exist.\nSarah Collins: And then I would need to rethink it to fellow. Oh, I also need to add myself.\nJoe Fleming: It. Yeah, but it allows you. So like while you're doing that, this so this is a very interesting and kind of It's it's a like kind of down the rabbit hole. Use case is by like using this feature. This way, if I'm not mistaken, it does allow you to have both your internal version of the notes. And a customer facing shared version of the notes. So, for example, give you a very concrete example. If you're like for the sales team, if you're having an implementation call for example, like a kickoff for POC, you can have the cross workspace. No.\nJoe Fleming: Which is nice and clean has the, like, the standard template and all the action items. And you will also because that note existed beforehand, if you've made sure that the note existed beforehand have a internal one, just for the people in your fellow workspace where you can have your own like internal notes that could say like You know Hey we need to make sure that we get this information on the call. Like Make sure to ask these questions and we can have an entire side conversation in our own notes. While the customer still has their customer facing now. So this is a interesting use case. It is down the rabbit hole though, for the feature. So Probably not that obvious for most people,…\""}

If so, who?” to influence the story you write.\n11. Output Title, My Name and Story using the template below to structure it’s design.\n11. Make sure the story you write is in the style of the author described previously, unless there wasn’t one described. This includes but is not limited to: wording, length, tone, character, genre, structure and plot. \n12. Make sure that include the topic I chose as the base of the story.\n13.

{"text": "CHAPTER SEVEN\nEMAIL MARKETING\n\nWhat is Email Marketing?\nEmail marketing is a form of direct marketing that gives companies the opportunity to\ncommunicate with customers on their contact list regarding new products, sales, and\nother updates. Because of its high ROI, it is an essential component of the overall inbound\nstrategy for the majority of businesses.\nConsent, segmentation, and personalization are the three main focuses of modern email\nmarketing, which has shifted away from sending out generic mass mailings and toward a\nmore targeted approach. Although it might sound like a time-consuming process,\nmarketing automation actually takes care of the majority of the hard work for you. Not\nonly does a well-designed strategy for email marketing help drive sales in the long run,\nbut it also assists in the development of a community that is centered on your brand.\n\nTypes of marketing emails\nEmail marketing can take the form of promotional messages, informational emails, or\nemails that serve a speci c function in the buyer's journey.\n\nPromotional emails\nEmail marketing campaigns can be used to promote limited-time sales and discounts,\nnewly released products, gated content such as ebooks and webinars, and your brand in\ngeneral. A campaign might include sending anywhere from three to ten emails over the\ncourse of several days or weeks.\nEmails used for marketing purposes always include a distinct \"call-to-action,\" or CTA for\nshort. The call to action (also known as the CTA) is the speci c action that you want the\nreader to take, such as viewing a particular page on your website or making use of a\ncoupon to make a purchase.\nThe frequency with which you send out emails of this kind is typically determined by the\nsales and marketing cadence of your company. It's possible that you'll send multiple\npromotional emails within the same twenty-four-hour period during crucial times of the\nyear like Black Friday. There might be a gap of a few weeks between each of your\npromotional campaigns depending on when in the marketing calendar slower periods\noccur.\n\nInformational emails\n\nNewsletters: As the word \"newsletter\" suggests, the purpose of a newsletter is to\ndisseminate information concerning your company. Consider having reached new\nmilestones, introducing new product capabilities, or highlighting valuable content such as\ncase studies. Newsletters, especially those that are sent at regular intervals (weekly, bi-\nweekly, or monthly), help maintain consistent touch points with the email subscribers you\nhave.\nHowever, were you aware that newsletters don't necessarily need to be about news?\nListen to what email guru Ann Handley has to say and concentrate on the letter aspect.\nImagine that you are writing a letter to each of your subscribers individually about a topic\nthat pertains to something that interests them.\nTo put it more simply, a newsletter is an opportunity to share insights, thoughts, and tips\nwith your audience. This could be anything that they nd valuable.\nEmail is the ideal medium for disseminating information to customers regarding company\nannouncements, new product releases, modi cations to the service, and other similar\ntopics.\nEmail is the primary mode of communication for vital messages the vast majority of the\ntime. Keeping in touch with your contacts through email is the most e ective method of\ncommunication in the event that there is a problem with your website, a holdup in the\nshipping process, or an interruption in your system or software. It is safe, it can be done\ninstantly, and it can have the same level of formality as the most important announcements.\n\nRe-engagement emails\nThe re-engagement email is an additional type of marketing email that is very important.\nRe-engagement emails, which are exactly what they sound like, are used to re-establish\ncommunication with clients or subscribers who have become inactive in recent times.\n\nWHY EMAIL MARKETING IS IMPORTANT\n\nEmail is not a recently developed technology. In point of fact, it was one of the very rst\ndigital communication methods to be developed and introduced in the year 1971.\nHowever, despite having been around for half a century, email marketing is more popular\nthan it has ever been.\nIt's possible that you're wondering to yourself, \"Do people really still use email?\" Isn't it true\nthat social media marketing is where it's at these days?\" Even though it's true that social\nmedia is an essential channel for any digital marketing strategy, email has a number of\nbene ts that set it apart from the competition.\nTo begin, marketing campaigns conducted via email allow for a greater degree of\npersonalization than those conducted via social media. Next, the costs of email marketing\nare signi cantly lower than those of other channels, which is especially advantageous\nwhen one considers the scope of the audience and the percentage of leads that are\nconverted. This is one of the many reasons why email marketing is such a good t for\nsmaller companies.\nIn conclusion, what makes email marketing so e ective and lucrative is the fact that it\nprovides you with direct and individual access to the inboxes of your target audience.\n\nHow to Do Email Marketing\n\nWhen it comes to sending promotional emails, companies make use of a category of\nsoftware known as email service providers, or ESP.\nA software that facilitates the sending of and management of email marketing campaigns\nis known as an email service provider.\nIt is also referred to as an email marketing service, an email marketing tool, and email\nmarketing software. Other names for it include an email marketing platform.\nYou may be thinking at this point, \"Why can't I just use my regular email service provider\nto send out marketing emails?\" Do I truly require the additional expense of purchasing a\nproduct on top of that?\nIt is feasible from a technical standpoint. However, exercise caution. There is a high\nprobability that you will experience di culties with your restricted email bandwidth,\ndesign, and most importantly, email deliverability. This is why:\nInternet Service Providers (ISPs) such as Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, and the like were created\nfor individual use and are not suitable for sending out mass emails. They do not, despite\nthe fact that they are free to use, come with a free bulk email sender. Therefore, when a\nmass email is sent from an Internet service provider (ISP), it is very easy for spam lters to\nidentify it as spam, and your account could be disabled for suspicious activity.\nOn the other hand, email service providers (ESPs) have the infrastructure necessary to\nensure good email deliverability rates. This refers to the ability to successfully deliver\nemails to the inboxes of your subscribers. Investing in a dedicated email marketing service\nis the best way to ensure that your email marketing e orts are successful from the very\nbeginning.\nHow to choose an email service provider\nBecause there are hundreds of ESPs available, it can be challenging to determine which\none is best for your company.\nSendinblue, Mailchimp, Constant Contact, Convertkit, Mailjet, Mailerlite, and HubSpot are\namong the most widely used options. Mailjet, Mailerlite, and HubSpot are also among the\nmost widely used.\nHere are some questions to help narrow down your options:\nWhat’s your budget? If it’s very limited, then cheap email marketing services should be your starting point.\nWhat kind of emails do you plan to send, and how often? This’ll give you an idea of your required email volume (i.e. number of email sends).\nIf you’ve already got a list of opt-in contacts, how many are there?\nWhat’s your skill level when it comes to designing emails? If you’re a complete beginner, you’ll want a drag-and-drop email editor. Email templates will also come in handy. On the other hand, if you prefer to code emails from scratch, you’ll be on the lookout for an HTML editor.\nDo you plan to set up automated email work ows? See what the ESP o ers in terms of email marketing automation. Some solutions only o er basic autoresponders.\nIf your business communicates with di erent buyer personas, what contact list segmentation capabilities are o ered?\nWill your business be sending transactional emails? (Note that these are not considered email marketing.) Some folks like to manage these emails with a separate service, while others prefer all emails under the same roof.\nYou should also give some thought to the requirements of the future. Have you settled on\na preferred ESP? Run some simulations with the following question: \"How much will this\nESP cost if my list grows to x?\" Does this electronic sportsbook (ESP) have the feature set\nto support me if I want to add x to my strategy? What kinds of integrations and applications am I going to be able to add on?\"\nIt's healthy to have a positive outlook on the future, but try not to get too carried away\nwith it. Obviously, you need to maintain your attention on what really matters for the time being.\nHow to get email lists for marketing\nYou won't be able to send email campaigns if there is no one to send them to, so it's time\nto start building a list of active subscribers who have opted in to receiving your messages.\nThat's right, you have the option to opt in. Because here's the thing about email contacts:\nEvery person on your email list needs to have given their express permission to be there\nin order to be included there.\nWhat exactly does that entail?\nWhen someone enters their email address into an email signup form on your blog,\nwebsite, landing pages, social media, or anywhere else, it indicates that they have\nconsented to receive emails from you in the future. \"Opt-in\" is the term used to refer to this\ntype of consent when discussing email. (What you mean by \"opting out\" is the same thing\nas \"unsubscribing.\")\nWhen it comes to complying with data protection laws and protecting the reputation of\nyour brand, permission-based marketing is an absolute necessity. After all, nobody likes a spammer\nBecause this is a fairly non-negotiable aspect of email marketing, the vast majority of\nESPs enable you to create signup forms so that your subscriber list can grow in a natural way.\nThe following is a list of tried-and-true methods for organically expanding your email list:\nAdd signup forms to your website and other places\nPut your email newsletter signup form in places where it will be seen by a lot of people\nand people will de nitely see it.\nBlog posts, the homepage, and the contact page are three common places where\nsubscribers can nd subscription forms. The addition of a pop-up form to your website is\nanother good idea to consider pursuing. Just make sure that the user experience is not\nsigni cantly altered by your changes. The use of pop-up windows that prevent visitors\nfrom accessing your website is a major turno . (Think of your signup form placement like\nyour call-to-action placement.)\nShare forms on social media by including a link in your bio or posts.\nMaintain or operate an e-commerce or online store? Include an option to sign up for the\nnewsletter as part of the process of checking out.\n\nUse lead magnets\n\nPremium content is the single most important factor in the growth of a list.\nThe distribution of password-protected content such as ebooks, reports, checklists, or\ninfographics can be an e ective means of expanding your contact list. In exchange for\nsigning up for your newsletter, visitors receive helpful content from your website. It's a win\nfor both sides! Check out these tips and tricks for content marketing to get additional\nideas and motivation!\nProviding people with unique opportunities to save money and sign up for your mailing\nlist is another excellent strategy. If you sign up for the newsletter of the clothing brand\nMango, for instance, you can receive a discount of ten percent on your very rst purchase.\n\nHow to design a marketing email\nCreating a design for an email does not have to be challenging or overly technical. You\ncan easily create stunning and professional marketing campaigns by using an editor that\nworks using a drag-and-drop interface.\nIt is not necessary to become preoccupied with the process of composing fancy and\nintricate emails. Creating an email that accurately represents your company's brand, in\nwhatever form that may take, should be your primary focus when composing electronic\ncorrespondence. In most cases, this entails maintaining a straightforward approach. You\nwill undoubtedly be able to improve upon this in the not-too-distant future.\n\nSave time with pre-made email templates\nEmail marketing templates are the ideal short cut to outstanding email design, and they\nare suitable for use by both novices and seasoned professionals.\nJust pick one you like. Adjust the colors and font to correspond with the aesthetic of your\nbrand. After that, you can recycle it for use in future email newsletters. Keeping the\ncontent current is all that will be required of you. Simple and uncomplicated!\n\nHow to write your email copy\n\nYour email copy needs to provide value, highlight topics that are interesting to your\naudience, and embody the tone of voice that your brand uses.\nTo write email copy that is persuasive and engaging, keep the following tips in mind:\nAsk yourself, “What does my audience need from me? How can I help?” Imagine you’re writing to one person.\nShow your brand personality. Tell a story.\nWrite to instill curiosity, starting with the email subject line — more on that below. Use a conversational tone and write the way you speak.\nBreak up the copy with short paragraphs and use bullet points where possible.\nUse the name of a real person for the email signature instead of a faceless brand logo.\n\nWhen is the best time to send a marketing email?\n\nBe strategic when selecting the day and time to send your emails, rather than picking\nthem at random. Consider what you already know about the people who will be viewing\nyour presentation, and decide on a time that will be most bene cial for them.\nAccording to the ndings of some studies, email marketing campaigns have a greater\nchance of being successful when they are distributed on Tuesdays or Thursdays at\napproximately ten o'clock in the morning or in the afternoon at approximately three o'clock in the afternoon.\nHowever, what is successful for the majority of people may not be successful for you. It is\nessential to conduct experiments at a variety of times in order to determine the optimal\ntime for your audience."}

But I have like these separate groups, like I have, like specific people that I talked to for different things. So there's, I mean, anytime there's, you know, 20 or 30 random groups of people that are being talked to about these things, whenever you have these conversations between all the group chat, some are the groups that people know about these things, other ones that people that are telling you put them up on stuff. Some are the people that are putting me up on stuff, you know, but there's, you know, what I also do every now and then I'll write about this stuff, too, right? When I have a when there's something that I really like, okay, you know, I will take an opportunity to spotlight or highlight. Like, for instance, it's not a streetwear brand, necessarily a black owned T Shirt Company, but I met the owner of the company is called Stupid stank. And actually, yes, so Brianna, so the, you know, I picked up one of the shirts from Nubian human, and I took a picture of it. And then she saw it, somebody pointed out to her that I had it on, she used she started using those pictures for her like, promo stuff. Anyway, so once I got I got a line on her, you know, I did a podcast episode with her is like to talk to her about her company, and how she does things, you know, so, so if I get an opportunity to amplify these things, typically, I will. You know, when when I like you like, um, you know, especially, especially the black owned brands, right, like, you know, I wrote an article about all of the black owned brand coach shoe collaborations that I own, you know, because I feel like that highlights the brand. And the black owned brands more so than it does the shoes like I'm a big fan of like Joe Fresh goods. And all of his new balance collaborations, like I have, not all of them but I have a substantial number of those but I've written about Joe Fresh goods and the campaign's that he's done, that are very black in nature, like the stuff that he did, or, you know, the conversations among us are the inside voices outside quote, all this stuff, like I've written about all of those things, because I like to amplify that stuff. It's not like he needs it, he has a huge following, but, you know, I feel like it's me doing my little part where I can to amplify, you know, black culture where where I can.\nOkay, cool, cool. And then I see that when when you're searching for brands, is it using your phone or computer? Is that a mixed or?\nThat's probably 90% My phone 10% My Computer,\nokay. Okay. So to shift a little bit on the technology front and a little more on the technology front. If you're creating playlists, right music playlists, what aspects of creating music playlists Do you enjoy? Oh,\nwas a couple of things. I like like most people who if you make playlists, you're always trying to create the perfect playlist. So I like putting in songs together and feeling like I literally put the perfect sequence of songs together, obviously feel and vibe like you know, like, I have a playlist for instance that I've been putting together that I call like PJ's keep up. Because it's all the songs my younger artists that my nieces and nephews just keep putting me up. All right, so I'm putting this together. But as I listen to these things, it introduces me to new artists and like, let me add this to it. Let me see if I can find it artists that work. So I like the discovery piece of it. Because, you know, there's I like how the algorithms that they have will send you in the direction on its own to find new new artists. So, you know, I enjoy trying to put together a perfect playlist, which, you know, I have not done yet."}

In the audit, substantial deficiencies were found, among other things for the chain of pigeons, and a lack of a quality manager standard for the factory. As a result, the Ministry of Health ordered the closure of the plant for three months to correct the deficiencies. Strauss decided to carry out works to improve the infrastructure at the factory and it did not open for four months, until today.\nIn an inspection conducted in August by the ministry, it emerged that the factory has upgraded the environmental sampling systems, finished product and raw materials and will now check every batch before it leaves the factory. In addition, sanitary improvements were made, including sealing roofs, cleaning, replacement of some of the equipment that required replacement, floors and crack fusion.\nA re-examination and change in the organizational structure was carried out, the manufacturer's responsibility was expanded by expanding the quality team, including quality controllers for the\n candy factory which, as mentioned, operated without a quality control manager, as well as an addition and a larger volume for the melting process in the liquid chocolate factory.\nThe Ministry of Health stated that \"the Ministry deems it appropriate to allow the plant to return to production in a phased manner while managing the environmental risks and implementing corrective actions and in coordination with the Ministry and approval at each stage of the phased return. From time to time and in light of the addition of additional products, the conditions will be re-examined and further control will be held later according to the need and the progress of the corrective actions \"."}

{"text": "Summarise: Attentional Guidance by Irrelevant Features Depends on Their Successful\nEncoding Into Working Memory\nDirk Kerzel and Stanislas Huynh Cong\nFaculté de Psychologie et des Sciences de l’Education, Université de Genève\nAttentional selection is guided by templates of the target in working memory. It has been proposed that\nattentional templates integrate target features (e.g., purple chair) to guide attention in an object-based\nfashion. Alternatively, it may be that attentional templates are established for each target feature individually (e.g., purple and chair). To provide support for the latter account, we used a task where participants memorized a target shape while ignoring an irrelevant color. In the combined condition, the shape\nwas shown in the irrelevant color. In the separate condition, the irrelevant color was spatially separate\nfrom the shape. After the initial presentation and a blank retention interval, participants were asked to\nmake a saccade to the initially viewed shape, which was shown together with a distractor. Attentional\nguidance by the irrelevant color was strongly reduced with separate presentation, suggesting that guidance is object-based. However, it may be that irrelevant color was less reliably encoded with separate\npresentation. Therefore, we asked participants to store the irrelevant color for later recall. With the additional memory task, guidance by irrelevant color occurred regardless of whether it was presented as part\nof an object or separately. Thus, effects of irrelevant features are easier to observe with combined presentation because all features of an object are automatically encoded into working memory, where they\nform integrated feature templates. Nonetheless, guidance by separate features is possible, but the poor\nencoding of irrelevant features with separate presentation makes it more difficult to observe"}

Make sure to cite results using [[number](URL)] notation after the reference. If the provided search results refer to multiple subjects with the same name, write separate answers for each subject.\nPrompt: summarise ;Tokenized LLC Formation\nLexDAO (opens new window)engineers derived a technique called Ricardian LLC (opens new window)that leverages the simple formation offered by Delaware Series LLCs but ensures separation of concerns and legal validity (opens new window)through the use of NFTs and a closely tailored Master operating agreement, which demonstrates uniqueness for Series through each NFT tokenId and provides administrative safeguards.\n\n#Wrappr LLC NFT\nWrappr LLC NFTs have extended this concept with ERC-1155 (opens new window)NFTs to provide even more flexibility in tracking LLC membership with balances attached to each NFT tokenId. Wrappr LLC NFTs are also the backend for KALI DAO deployments (opens new window)that choose an automated LLC legal structure.\n\nIf users select Delaware or Wyoming LLC as an option on the Wrappr app (opens new window), they will receive a mint on an ERC-1155 NFT that has a Series LLC agreement attached and completed through the terms of the Master operating agreement, stored and signable on Ethereum and IPFS under ricardian.eth (Delaware copy (opens new window), Wyoming copy (opens new window)).\n\n#How Much Does It Cost?\nIncluding gas fees to mint a Wrappr LLC NFT, the cost is roughly $25, which supports the maintenance of the Series LLC registrations with the state and ensuring the operating agreements are valid under applicable laws, which may change from time to time.\n\n#DAOs & LLCs\nLLCs can operate on behalf of an organization whose rules and finances are handled entirely by smart contracts with open hierarchies, or \"DAOs (opens new window)\".\n\nA Wrappr user might in this case attach an LLC NFT to their wallet or multi-sig and use this account to receive funds from a DAO treasury to purchase IRL assets or pay expenses on behalf of the DAO. The LLC will protect this user from liability related to the DAO, given them a separate legal personality to manage the DAO's affairs (providing privacy), and protect them from personal liability related to these affairs, as well. To establish such DAO representative relationships with more legal backing, it is recommended to consult and execute an agreement such as this form of DAO Representation Agreement (opens new window).\n\nDAOs may also \"wrap\" their membership (often represented by token balances held by a public key account) into an LLC, treating tokens as membership units under the terms of their LLC operating agreement.\n\nA Wrappr user might in this case attach an LLC NFT to their DAO treasury or multi-sig. The terms of the Master operating agreement backing the Wrappr LLC NFTs will treat the key holders governing such shared account as LLC members and their collected assets and transactions as those of the LLC. This streamlines the operation of the LLC and provides automated accounting, a blockchain superpower.\n\n#Do LLCs Centralize DAOs?\nSince DAOs and LLCs share common structuring through private ordering (i.e., membership and operating rules are set by agreement), the mere creation of an LLC does not centralize the membership but simply provides an IRL interface and legal name to the DAO. Essentially, a DAO is already an operating agreement represented by code--an LLC just provides a legal identity to this code to deal with the public. Anonymity is not compromised--membership is not disclosed to the state or anyone. In using Wrappr LLC NFTs, the DAO also is not required to hire any representatives to manage off-chain affairs, providing even greater privacy to DAOs. At the end of the day, the DAO LLC can be converted to another entity structure or discarded at any time by the DAO members, preserving autonomy.\n\n#Opening Bank Accounts\nOpening a bank account and obtaining an EIN for LLCs can be handled by the LexDAO Clinic (opens new window). (Note, you will need an EIN for banking and taxes.)\n\nUsers can also receive their EIN by filling out a basic form online (opens new window).\n\nNote, when you apply for your EIN, you should ensure that the name you apply with clearly denotes that your LLC is a Series LLC and reflects the jurisdiction of formation (Delaware or Wyoming). For Delaware naming, this can be done using the format: [Your Name] LLC, a Series of Wrappr LLC, and for Wyoming, the name attached to your Series operating agreement, such as Wrappr LLC – [Your Name] – Series 1.\n\nMercury (opens new window)also provides a web3-friendly application form (opens new window)to get started and quickly setup banking for LLC DAOs.\n\n#Handling Taxes\nThe maintenance of the Wrappr LLC filings, registered agent and annual State franchise tax is handled by the KALI (opens new window)team for the public benefit. This means that you don't need to pay taxes to Delaware or Wyoming on the LLC registration or any other maintenance fees. Your tax obligations will be with regard to your own members and any income generated by your LLC, which will involve filing an annual report to the IRS and preparing K-1s for members.\n\nAnnual reports and issuing partnership K-1s for LLC members can be handled by the LexDAO Clinic (opens new window), or if the LLC wants to be taxed as a corporation to simplify accounting, such filings can be similarly handled and taken off your plate.\n\n#Onboarding Investors\nPurchases of shares in your LLC for investment purposes should respect local law and applicable regulations. It is recommended to retain counsel if the Wrappr LLC is formed for the purposes of raising funds for group investment or to capitalize a team operating the LLC to develop a product or provide services. LexDAO maintains a curated list of counsel (opens new window), with practice areas and jurisdictions for public reference.\n\nWhile automated investor onboarding processes are added to the Wrappr application in partnership with kycDAO (opens new window), users can also take advantage of KALI (opens new window)open source legal forms for self-certification of investors in private sales (i.e., not marketed to general public), provided here (opens new window). If the sale is public and not handled through private marketing to your network, taking advantage of the Wrappr whitelisted minting and transfers is recommended, as well as obtaining a letter of accreditation for each investor, a form of which is provided here (opens new window)and can be filled out by your counsel. If you have more questions do not hesitate to reach out to the KALI team (contact@kali.gg).\n\n#DAO LLC Examples\nExamples of DAO LLCs in the wild include MetaCartel Ventures (opens new window) and The LAO (opens new window)investment clubs."}

I'm retired. I sold building products for 30 years. Prior to that, I was a carpenter in the field for the most part. I've had a few other jobs along the way, but those were the two main things I did.\n\n08:41:39:00 A college degree. \n\n08:41:41:00 Family: I have a wife of 40 years and 3 kids: 36, 32, and 26.\n\n08:41:52:00 Our oldest, Alicia, has two kids, so we have two grandchildren.\n\n08:41:58:00 That's kind of the early part of my biography. Is there more?\n\nInterviewer: That's great. That's great. We're going to get you just to say, \"My name is Ken, I'm living with LEMS.\"\n\nKen: Okay.\n\nInterviewer: ...just do that.\n\n08:42:15:00\nKen: My name is Ken, and I'm living with LEMS.\n\n08:42:18:00 My name is Ken, and I'm living with LEMS.\n\n08:42:22:00 My name is Ken, and I'm living with LEMS.\n\n08:42:25:00 My name is Ken, and I'm living with LEMS.\n\nInterviewer: Great. Awesome. What do you like to do in your free time? Do you have any hobbies?\n\n08:42:34:00\nKen: You know I do a lot of things. I don't know that I have one particular hobby.\n\n08:42:39:00 Being a carpenter, I still do woodworking. I'm outdoors most of the time.\n\n08:42:46:00 With LEMS, I have a hard time in the middle of the day when it's hot, but I'm out mornings and evenings.\n\n08:42:53:00 I'm retired, so I do the gardening and all the outdoor stuff around the house. But then we still camp and backpack and kayak and bicycle. \n\n08:43:05:00 We're very involved with our community, so I stay very busy even though I am retired. But it's kind of a time to give back.\n\n08:43:16:00\nInterviewer: Fantastic. Tell me a little bit about your experiences living with LEMS. What are the things that you do maybe to kind of compensate? Is there anything ... limitations?\n\nKen: Mm-hmm.\n\n08:43:27:00 Well, living with LEMS, for me anyways, is getting up and getting moving every single day and never stop making plans for the future. And so, in doing that, I just—\n\n08:43:45:00 My wife still works. She'll work until the end of this year, and then she'll retire. \n\n08:43:50:00 So, in the morning, I get up, I get her off to work, walk her out to her car, give her a kiss, thank you for making money, you know, that kind of thing, right? And then, you know, tidy up the house, and then I have things I do.\n\n08:44:03:00 During the pandemic, I did a lot of remote teaching for our granddaughter because I was available. It was just very interesting and very rewarding, that was. \n\n08:44:15:00 But we travel. We do a lot of travel. We were in Ireland earlier this year, and I'm on Lake Michigan for a couple of weeks once I leave here. So—\n\n08:44:27:00 And then we've got other trips planned for before the year ends. We don't travel so much in the winter. We're more local. But we do a lot of things like cross-country skiing and winter sports. I still skate when I can. I don't skate as well as I could when I was a kid because I have LEMS, but I can still skate.\n\n08:44:47:00 Skating is actually a little easier than walking sometimes. \n\n08:44:53:00\nInterviewer: That's interesting. \n\n[CUT]\n\nInterviewer: ...LEMS?\n\n08:46:14:00\nKen: Well, having LEMS, the only person that you see with LEMS is the one in the mirror. That's it. Then I get to come here, and I sit in a room with ten other people that walk in the same shoes I do, have the same experiences I have. \n\n08:46:34:00 We can commiserate on all kinds of things: what we can do, what we are having challenges doing, different types of doctors, and things like that. That because it's so rare, it's the only time I'd ever get an opportunity to talk with people that are going through the same thing I am.\n\n08:46:55:00 It has been just a very wonderful weekend to just have time to talk to people and in different stages of LEMS and in different challenges that they have, but all of them with the same challenges. \n\n08:47:11:00 When I was at a LEMS event and we were talking, and at one point someone there said, \"Do you ever do this?\" you know, rub their legs. And every LEMS patient's hands went up going, \"Oh, yeah. We all do that.\"\n\n08:47:28:00 Well, that's something that you can't share with the general population. They wouldn't have any idea what you're speaking of, right? They wouldn't know what you were talking about.\n\n08:47:38:00\nInterviewer: Sense of....\n\n08:47:40:00\nKen: It has been, and we've exchanged numbers. We'll stay in contact with each other. It becomes more, \"You're not in this alone. You've got brothers and sisters that are in this,\" and that's how it felt this weekend.\n\n[CUT]\n\n08:48:14:00\nInterviewer: --experience?\n\n08:48:15:00\nKen: Well, I did four years prior to diagnosis, and those symptoms are different than the four and a half years since I've been diagnosed and I've been on Firdapse and I—\n\n08:48:27:00 And so, I kind of look at that as two sides. You know what I deal with now is knowing I have LEMS, knowing I have some challenges every day, but just getting up and getting after it, and not letting – not trying to dwell on it. Just, you know—\n\n08:48:47:00 I don't want LEMS to ever define me. I can define myself. I don't need LEMS to do that.\n\n08:48:54:00 But prior to being diagnosed was different because you didn't know what you had. I wanted to be defined by not being sick, but I was sick. I was struggling. \n\n08:49:10:00 When I first started noticing, and this like 2014, it was an awkwardness, and my office was down the hall, and I would walk down that hallway, and it was like I was leaning or listing to the left. And it was like something is not right here."}

Given the organic growth of the Fairbnb.coop, we recommend starting with 5% and not exceeding 10%. That, of course, depends on the available accommodation types in your node. If most available accommodation is in the large hotels, then the total percentage of the potential capacity included in the Fairbnb.coop market is less, and vice versa. However, play around with those numbers and imagine all the possibilities.\n \nAverage length of stay\n \nThis item refers to the average length of stay in your local node that you can find in statistical reports or on the Tourism Board's web site. In case you can't find those data, or they don't exist for your node, you can use the general value of 2,5 days.\n\nAverage price for night\n \nWe recommend you find and enter the latest data on airdna or insiderairbnb.\n\nOccupancy rate\n​\nPlease note that this item doesn't refer to the average occupancy rate in your local node that you can find in statistical reports or on the Tourism Board's web site. It refers only to the bookings the hosts might have through our platform. Given our development phase and the fact that the majority of the hosts are present on other platforms as well, we suggest you start with entering the lowest occupancy rate (15%) and try higher percentages for the years to come.\n \nIncome and Local Taxes Input:\n \nThink of different tax plans available for specific types of hosts and figure out approximately the average value for all of them to get a glimpse of how much money could be returned to your local node, region, or country.

In the summer, when he was not in the mood \nfor blacksmithing, he became absorbed with fishing. One time, when he went \nfishing for river trout (iwana), he caught enough fish to fill a bamboo basket.\nHe was returning on a mountain road when he came to a stone marker desig\u0002nating the entrance to the village. There was a small Buddhist monk–like ghost \nfigure with a shaven head standing in the grass. Wondering who it might be, \nhe looked, and the figure became larger and larger, becoming a huge monster \n(norikoshi) seeming to penetrate the clouds. Shocked, Gonzo is said to have run \nall the way home. (163-171)\nO\nAccording to Tetsuzo of Tsuchibuchi village, there are many strange things \nthat happen in the Taimagura Pond across from Oguni village on Mt. Haya\u0002chine. A man from Shimomura went fishing for iwana and came across a red\u0002faced old man (tengu) and a young girl in the shadow of a rocky cavern deep \nin the mountains. They were dressed rather strangely. In the Taimagura area, \nthere are several spots where there were ancient rock dwellings on both sides of \na stream. The dwellings were almost circular, only about three meters wide, and \nthe open entrance was one meter high. It is said that at one time people lived \nthere. Even now, it seems that someone is there. Tetsuzo, who told this story, \nsays that if he listens carefully while he is fishing, he can hear a cock crow nearby. \nThis story is from about ten years ago. (164-121)\nO\nThere was a man who came to Yamada Bay in Shimohei from Sekiguchi \nvalley to buy things on market days. His face was hairy, and the color of his \neyes was unusual. The locals doubted that he was a normal human being, so \nthey killed him and then buried him on the “larger island” in Yamada Bay. \nKilling him was one thing, but since then the number of fish being caught in \nthe bay has declined.\nThe larger island in Yamada Bay was also known as the “Dutch Island” \nbecause the Dutch ship, the Breskens, landed there on June 10, 1643, in search \nof food and water supplies. The ship’s crew was welcomed by the people of \nYamada, but on July 28, the crew was arrested and taken to the military shogun, \nTokugawa Iemitsu, in the national capital of Edo.

Around this time, European ships came to the area in search of \nJapanese gold mines.\nThis story was told by old man Tora of Tsuchibuchi village, who, when he \nwas young, would transport packhorses over to Yamada. (165-107)\nO\nThere was a hunter named Kikuchi Eisaku from Wano in Tochinai. He spent \na day hunting in the mountains of Oide near Mt. Hayachine. He was relying on \nthe soft evening light coming through the trees to find his way to a small hut \nwhen, all of a sudden, he came upon another man. The man’s round eyes glared \ndefensively as he passed. Thinking it strange, the hunter asked him where he \nwas going. The man replied that he was going to a hut in the pastureland. The \nman pushed aside the dense brush and scurried off.\nSasaki Kizen was a friend of this hunter, and the story was heard directly from \nhim. It was unlikely that there would be anyone in the hut in the pasture in win\u0002ter. It was also hard to discern the man’s features in the dim evening light, but he \nwore a fairly common tight-sleeved, rough linen coat and had a bag-like object \nmade from wisteria vines hanging from his shoulder. He was about two meters \ntall and about the same age as the hunter. This was in the winter of 1913. At that \ntime, the hunter was a youthful twenty-five or twenty-six years old. (166-106)\nO\nThis story is from around 1920. A child from Komaki in Matsuzaki village \nencountered a large man on Mt. Nishinai. It was just past noon one day during \nSeptember or October when people gather bush clover (hagi) to be used as feed \nfor their horses. The child peeked out from behind the bushes and saw a large man \nwearing a common tight-sleeved, rough cotton coat. He had a bag-like object made \nfrom wisteria vines hanging from his shoulder, and the bag had a number of snakes \nsquirming around inside. Frightened, the child crouched down in the bushes, and \nthe man passed right in front of him in great haste. Feeling relieved that he was \nalive, he took off running back to the village. I heard this story from some young \npeople one night in January when children play New Year’s games.

Modernized internal stack capable of meeting the needs of a cloud-first business\n 3. Best in class investor management through transformation process, as we delicately manage the growth of platform offerings in a way that doesn't negatively impact our valuation in the long term\n 4. Decreasing our capital intensity through operating efficiencies driven by technology and automation \n 5. Developing a suite of digital platform solutions from solving cloud issues to digital transformations \n 6. Building a partner ecosystem to expand and support our offerings\n 7. Solving go-to-market, legal, and financial compliance challenges related to operating a platform business internationally\n \n2. Brandi\n · …Modernized internal stack capable of meeting the needs of a cloud-first business.\n · Evolve culture to accelerate delivery of platform vision\n · Acquire and develop talent fit for platform vision\n \n3. Bruce\n · Be public about a quantifiable aspiration/goal to fuel urgency (e.g. Interconnection revenue or yield)\n · Get org rallied around a shared vision and then be very targeted in culture change (e.g. agile) and skills change needed in specific pockets of the org to deliver digital transformation. Ie. We need everyone to understand our vision, but we can be targeted on the where need new skills/capabilities\n · Enhance our local market and customer listening to drive innovation, using customer base for rapid beta testing or prototypes.\n \n4. Charles\n 1. IBX Footprint\n 2. Service Offerings\n a. Colo\n b. Mgd Services\n c. Edge Infra (Network Edge and Colo by the U)\n d. Cloud Networking\n 3. Digital Experience (likely starts as somewhat parallel experiences for DCS vs DS offerings but implies a merged experience over time)\n a. Process\n b. Systems\n 4. Ecosystem Enablement (huge area of opportunity and under-investment)\n a. APIs\n b. SDKs (that’s all the acronyms I know but I’m pretty sure we have a lot of work to do)\n 5. Customers – need to define target personas and align GTM motions to specific customer/persona combinations\n 6. Ecosystem Development\n a. JPS/”integrated”\n b. Self-serve (use self-serve tools to bring your offering to the Platform)\n c. Communities of Interest/Vertical Ecosystems (BD to cultivate)\n 7. Marketplace (what we need, not what we have now)\n\n \n \n5. Jon\n · Modernized quote-to-cash stack that allows for low/no-touch customer acquisition and onboarding, and global billing capabilities.\n · Having clear, measurable ROIC for digital services with clear cost structures by product line.\n · Building integrated partner offerings that allow partners to package/sell/support our offerings with low/no-touch for Equinix.\n · Creating clear BU and product-level P&L reporting, inclusive of capex and opex.\n · Having the clear ability to calculate LTV/CAC by product.\n \n6. Justin\n · Investing in a modern API-first technology stack to be able to effectively leverage developer ecosystems to (1) co-drive disruptive, agile innovation; (2) create new business models; (3) enable seamless API-based technology partner integration; and (4) reduce channel friction.\n · Continuing to improve Equinix’s visibility and credibility in developer ecosystems to attract world-class talent capable of delivering on our Platform vision.\n · Investing in an innovation incubator with dedicated engineering resources, and frameworks in place to engage and co-innovate with external developers and startups with agility, to boost innovation (radical innovation, adjacent innovation, or core innovation), supported by an accelerated incubation model.\n \n7. Karl\n · …seriously vet and conclude on inorganic options to accelerate our capability set to deliver the suite of services required. (Contemplates the addition of talent, tech, and product needed to accelerate)\n · …successfully launch AND scale Joint partner solutions that prove we are indeed the home of the dedicated cloud and can offer solutions via partners at scale.\n · …neutralize the complexity of workload tiering and demand shaping by having both retail and wholesale solutions to large and performance based deployments.\n \n \n8. Keith\n · Developing a platform on Equinix DCS assets, and potentially extending these services to other non-Equinix assets.\n · Potentially acquiring talent or service capabilities and integrating onto the Equinix Platform.\n · Merging our business into an existing business and integrating onto the Equinix Platform.\n · Exclusively expand our GTM partnerships with a number of critical providers that imbeds our service offering into their solution.\n \n9. Kurt\n · …Honestly, I think the above list is a really good list. I am struggling to add anything to it. \n · If I had to, I would say we need a capability of coming to agreement more quickly on complex issues impacting our delivery and development of services. We are currently wrestling with issues that we have known for year. Channel complications (same ones) have been on the table for years, tax structure has been on the table for years and we actually built a tax structure no one is using a while back, we have known about billing issues since we bought packet, etc. The problem is, as soon as folks hear “hard problem” they retreat and we don’t move. To date, we have really struggled to resolve these issues quickly enough and with certainty for a time. I would never say we need decisions that last forever as we need to be agile, but the word I hear a lot on the street is the team is “Whipsawed.” It feels like folks run to work on something based on an agreement and then it changes a few months out, not usually with a discussion. \n · With that said, the list above actually sounds great to me. We need the right talent, working on the right stuff, for the right customers, and the story will tell itself.\n \n10. Mike\n · Acquire and Develop Talent capable of delivering our Platform vision.\n · Build a partner ecosystem to expand and support our offerings.\n · Begin to market ourselves as a company that provides a lot more than colocation services to different personas than we market to today.\n · Find a way to use xScale facilities to help with our Retail and Digital space constraints.\n \n11. Milind\n\n12. Nicole \n· People/Workforce/Brand:\n · Specific declaration on future state vision (internally). Take any guesses or confusion off the table immediately and ensure all functions are clear on how they play a role in that vision. \n · T&A to drive talent into the workforce that has experience suited for our vision (less telco, more software, service provider, etc..). \n · Marketing driving significant brand shift externally to ensure customers see us as a platform company. We are moving away from data center only branding. (This likely requires a CMO strategy) \n · Drive more accountability with our GLO population to lead from the front and be transformational leaders. Communicate often, effectively, and more intimately with this group so they are 100% clear on the strategy and role they play in the transformation. Have courage to take swift action if leaders can’t make the turn. This group of leaders will make or break us future state. \n· Growth and Bookings: \n · Global salesforce enabled and delivering balanced performance and growth targets across the product portfolio. \n · Internal functions working towards common vision and solving problems in partnership and at pace. \n · Specific and strategic synergy plans formally in place across critical enterprise partnerships (Dell, VMW, HPE)\n · Sustainability efforts clearly defined, articulated, and structured goaling for internal leadership in place. \n · Product clarity in digital space. What products, to what market, etc.. Keep this simple so sales can accelerate the strategy. Complexity will slow our pace. \n \n· Systems/Tools/Processes\n · Modernize our internal stack to be able to provide a customer experience needed for digital scale. Be progressive and aggressive in our IT shift. Don’t always think about “build” motions, also look at “buy” motions to implement with speed. \n · Data Transformation strategy in place (as part of our overall digital transformation strategy) in place to ensure Network Transformation, MDM/Analytics, etc, have structured execution dates (with timelines) and are scaling to enable faster decisions with more data driven insights. \n · Real time capacity management tools that help us balance DCS and DS needs by data center (I am not sure how mature these are today, and am assuming we will need advancement here). \n · API mandatory for all new builds. Basically, no more in house building that aren’t API enabled. \n\n \n13. PVC\n · …If I accurately understand the list, 1, 2, 5, and 6 are areas I’d apply energy….. 3, 4, and 7 will draw effort, but should naturally occur as we progress in the others. \n \n14. Raouf\n · …The right talent to build the products and scale the “wrapper” service model. \n · Modernized systems to support DS but also Enterprise support ready. \n · Network/DS architecture to scale and have the right unto cost. Truly support on demand growth and ramp for customers. \n · Solve go to market approach for combined customers from contracting, ordering and billing to support. \n \n15. Ryan\n 1. Acquire and develop talent capable of delivering Platform vision.\n 2. Overhaul internal systems and processes to enable efficiency and improved experience for customers and front-line employees. \n 3. Instill agility into culture and processes. \n \n16. Scott\n · It is hard to improve upon the ones listed, but I'd change the last to read:\n · Creating a highly competitive transactional, legal, and financial operating model necessary for the on-demand SaaS/cloud market\n · And I'd add:\n · Build the optimal platform to capture cloud-adjacent workloads and data. \"Platform\" is inclusive of our offerings and integrated offerings from ecosystem partners."}

{"text": "A. Here are the problems Comparative Solves: The data analytics space is fundamentally broken – companies invest hundreds of thousands, often millions of dollars into complex tooling, processes, dashboards and teams – and still frequently don’t understand why key metrics change. Performing meaningful analysis in order to understand the why changes in key metrics occur in order to make the right business decisions is: Resource intensive: requires teams of analysts and data analytics tools to try to create a robust picture. Shortage of quality talent makes it impossible to built out the required teams. Complex: Managers rely on business analysts to scan hundreds of dashboards and segments, and dive into ad hoc queries. Slow: Queries take minutes to run, and thousands are required to explore the data. Error Prone: Human bias, correlation errors, distribution and outlier skews and questions of statistical significance makes it difficult to trust the result, and hidden insights are missed. Expensive: For a large dataset it would cost tens of thousands of dollars per month in data warehouses query costs to run comprehensive analysis across all key metrics and segments daily. Data Analysts and scientists who accurately diagnose changes in metrics are in effect following a simple, but time consuming algorithm: Filtering multiple dashboards to find segments that have a profound change Applying multiple statistical tests to control for correlation, statistical significance, overall impact. Once they’ve found a segment, they’ll look at the changes across other metrics. Their work is a manual algorithm repeatedly applied. This is simple, but it requires expertise, it's time consuming, and expensive. For any large data set – applying this algorithm would cost tens of thousands of dollars per month in data warehouses query costs.\n\nAgain, I'm providing information about my company Comparative. DO NOT WRITE emails until I say \"GO\". Rather provide me a summary of the information I'm sharing one by one."}

{"text": "Summarise in the following article in no more than 5 dot points.\n\nWhat are latent conditions?\nGenerally, latent conditions are those that cannot be identified during site inspection and following reasonable investigation. Latent conditions cover not only those things which are obvious on the surface of the land and the soil itself but also utility services, mine shafts, contamination and other subsurface features.\n\nA latent condition is a physical condition on or near a relevant site that could not have been reasonably anticipated by a contractor at the time of tendering. The contractor is required to have conducted all reasonable inspections of the site and obtained necessary reports including foundation data. The meaning of a latent condition and the options for relief will vary depending on the contract or project. It may depend on the amount of information available to the contractor before the entered into the contract. The smallest differences in written language and wording will result in substantially different outcomes. Read on to find out more about latent conditions.\n\nWho is responsible for latent conditions?\nLatent conditions are usually dealt with by a process of shifting or sharing the risk. In the past, the homeowner often shouldered the risk of latent conditions, because they often had more knowledge of the site. In recent years the practice has been to shift that risk to the contractor. Along with this shift, there are now increased expectations of the contractor’s expertise.\n\nWhen decisions are made about the allocation of risk for latent conditions at the site, parties can consider:\n\n1. the physical conditions of the site\n\n2. the existing information about the site\n\n3. whether there are any existing investigations into the site (including the brief to the entity who investigated the site and the outcome of the investigations)\n\n4. the level of expertise of the person who carried out the investigation\nWhat are examples of a latent condition?\nCommon examples of potential latent conditions include: \n\n1. Hazardous materials; \n2. Contaminated soil including Asbestos in soil, Contaminated soil\n3. Conditions below the ground such as rocks, cavities, underground structures or soil density, Aboriginal artifacts or relics; \n4. Hidden building services such as Telstra pits, plumbing, cabling, electricity, data or air conditioning ductwork that may be hidden above ceilings, below floors or behind walls; and \n5. Any other types of physical features, active or redundant, that could not be reasonably be anticipated. \n\nLatent conditions exclude weather. It is important to note that a condition treated as latent in one contract, may not be latent for the purposes of another. In each case, the wording of a contact must be carefully considered to determine whether the condition is in fact a latent condition."}

{"text": "Yeah, 2000 I was trying to get to this next level, but you know, the parts that are made\n in China are not subject to a tariff, so that's certainly helpful.\n We also save on logistics and generally we found that locally sourced parts in China\n cost less than in the US or Europe.\n So this is all pretty helpful.\n So Tesla got added to the purchase tax exemption, which all the other...\n I'm not sure if you'll realize just how much of an off-field battle Tesla's had to sell\n cars in China.\n It's been a really...\n And basically no access to any of the subsidies and we paid a tariff and we had to ship the\n cars over.\n And every single thing was set against Tesla and still we made progress and did decently\n well.\n So I think that there will be much better situation with local production, not having\n to do shipping and tariffs and being able to have lower cost, local sourcing of components.\n So it would make a big difference I think.\n Is that your victory dance?\n When you broke ran into that?\n Yeah, that's great.\n It's a big deal.\n Huge.\n Yeah, just...\n It's just fundamental economics.\n It kind of makes sense that making cars on the continent where there are boards will\n be a lot more efficient than making them in California and chipping them around the world.\n Yeah.\n Yeah.\n And you can get paid for the cars before paying your suppliers, which seems to not be the\n case if you're shipping around the world.\n Right.\n And it's like friction on the whole kind of cash flow situation or it has been.\n For sure.\n It will sure make a big difference on cash flow because yeah, there's just no way to\n get the cars, especially to Europe, but we're even trying to get them to customers before\n we have to pay suppliers.\n So if you're a rapidly growing company, it's nine day if you get paid by your customers\n before you have to pay your suppliers, like night and day.\n Because in the faster you grow, the video cash position is.\n But if it's the other way around where you have to pay your suppliers before you get paid\n by customers, then the faster you grow, the faster your cash position drops.\n Yes, you're up, yes.\n Because you spend more money to make your own.\n Yes, it's a growth actually causes you to over into the ground in a situation like that.\n Now it tells you we had a mixture of both things where we had a lot of customers in\n say in California.\n And that's fast.\n For sure, we would get paid by customers faster than we'd have to pay suppliers.\n But then for cars going to Europe and Asia, it's the other way around.\n So we would have to pay suppliers before we got paid by customers.\n And now we could offset some of that with the asset back line, which was pretty helpful,\n but only some of it, not all of it.\n So the fundamental financial health for sure improves dramatically by just having a factory\n on the continent.\n We're not talking next door, but it's just how many ocean, especially Europe was logistically\n super hard because we're on the West Coast.\n If we're on the East Coast, then China would be much harder.\n But if you're on the West Coast, you're from the charter because you've got to go to the\n Panama Canal or even worse around Tierra del Fuego.\n Because sometimes the Panama Canal get backed up and you're like, \"This friggin' ship is\n going to the Antarctic.\"\n It's like you could skip up to the end and it stole me as hell.\n It's just so you could just send a ship around chilling.\n Are you kidding?\n In the middle of crazy storms and then back up all the way and then it is too funny.\n Oh my God.\n So let me just take nightmare.\n So yeah, it'd be great to just have it not get on a boat.\n It crossed the Pacific and Atlantic and that kind of thing.\n So maybe similar to Vincent's question, what's the biggest advantage in choosing Berlin\n compared to other European countries?\n Berlin has the best nightclubs.\n That's true.\n How many bit?\n I went to Brooklyn once.\n Really?\n Yeah.\n Holy shit.\n That's cool.\n Yeah, it was a few years ago.\n Well, I don't know.\n I mean, he looked at a lot of different locations and I don't know.\n We could have put him in a lot of locations.\n We needed to move quickly and actually this place, it's like 30 minutes to the outskirts\n of Berlin, technically in Brandenburg.\n It actually was a place location that BMW was going to put a plant there.\n So a ton of the environmental work and all of the permits and stuff had already been\n done.\n And then for some reason, BMW chose a different location.\n But there's like, I guess, something on the order of a year's worth of environmental paperwork\n and stuff that's been done on that location for an auto plant.\n So that's one of the quickest places to get going.\n And generally, the government, local and state government was very supportive.\n So I went there and it's like, OK, this seems like some pretty good vibes this place.\n So this is a lovely part of this lovely place.\n And there's an opportunity for-- it's close enough to Berlin that say young people could\n still live in an apartment in Berlin and commute to the factory.\n It's right, there's a train station.\n They actually can move the train station.\n It's a small train station.\n But they're going to move the train station to where you can literally get off the train\n and be right at the gig of Berlin.\n Wow.\n That's great.\n That's great.\n It could literally just pop right off and walk very unadvisable.\n So then it's like, OK, this is pretty cool.\n And so young people could be in Berlin, apartment, and it's a little quirky here in Berlin.\n But if you want to have more of a family situation, the backyard is affordable, housing available\n with houses with yards and stuff that aren't too expensive.\n Yeah.\n So it seems like a good combination of factors.\n Yeah, a lot of talent in the area.\n So it sounds cool to Google in.\n It just sounds like some cool nightclub, I think.\n You could definitely have a cool nightclub that was cool, but yeah, it sounds good.\n It sounds pretty cool.\n It's pretty fun.\n It's a party gig-ish.\n Yeah.\n It's sort of like a rave cave in the...\n There's a lot of space around the factory side.\n But you should have your own nightclub.\n Yeah.\n I think that would be...\n Who doesn't know what to do?\n I don't know if he doesn't know what to do with that.\n I feel like I'd go for sure a work at a company that's got the nightclub.\n That sounds way more fun.\n Didn't you want to put a roller coaster into the Fremont factory?\n Yeah.\n You're still going to do that?\n I mean, I think that would be pretty fun to do.\n Yeah.\n I think we can just do...\n Yeah, just basically have like...\n We just needed a rail that can support like a modified Tesla's.\n And then...\n Oh my God.\n Can you imagine a plaid flat?\n Yeah, just like zip around.\n Around the factory in like five seconds.\n Yours would be booked for months.\n Yeah, we should get it right now.\n Awesome.\n Yeah, we're kind of actually in various parts of the factory, we have vehicle conveyance\n systems.\n They just don't move that fast.\n But they're kind of like roller coasters that move slowly.\n You can speed up.\n Yeah, you can speed up.\n Exactly.\n So, yeah.\n But yeah, we're all from feeling pretty...\n You know, we're not a tent fade or anything, but feeling pretty good about where things\n are headed.\n And I think this is a lot of good things.\n You know, Model Y coming out this year.\n And some exciting announcements about batteries.\n A lot of progress in autopilot.\n Yeah.\n Yeah.\n So, pulling, giga-balloon.\n And then making progress in some of the new vehicle developments.\n And solo the solar roof, solar glass roof.\n Getting that rolled out.\n The Cybertruck got received really well, I think.\n Yeah.\n Did you expect that many orders?\n No, not really.\n It's amazing.\n When I first saw the Cybertruck in France's design studio, I mean, you know, it had told\n me that this was a daring design.\n Although, I think you're the most excited about this design than any design.\n Yeah, I thought it would be the best product ever.\n Yeah.\n And I saw it.\n I was just taken aback.\n And not by the design so much, by the pure aggression that the truck, you stand in front\n of it and you're like, \"Okay, I'm afraid.\"\n You know, it really is like a badass truck.\n Yeah.\n Yeah.\n Well, it seems like a lot of reasons why people buy pickup trucks in the US is like,\n because it's like the most badass truck.\n You know, like, which one is the toughest truck?\n And it's like, what's tougher than a truck?\n A tank.\n That's a good one.\n Like a tank from the future.\n So, it's like...\n My niece and Parker, which is near Paloburishi, the dirt bath, rider, champion, and a really\n fine side of the truck to the order just the day...\n Fine side of the truck.\n She just encased the first four, R-Bizzy.\n Yeah, part of the book reads her.\n She's stuck her neck.\n And she was a cool boy.\n Yeah, absolutely.\n They just love it.\n Yeah.\n\nclean

The growth of Ethereum smart contracts set the foundations for The Render Network to build an end-to-end holographic economy. GPU mining has built a supply of miners that far exceeds the centralized public GPU Cloud. On top of millions of GPU’s now available for holographic compute, Blockchain technology has evolved now to store, validate and time-stamp complex mixes of technical specifications, schedules, accounts, regulations, protocols, standards, and property rights.

I was invested by an outsourcing company, most of their client are Japanese company. I was quite shocked about many requirement and rule to work with them. I have to learn a lot, start writing my first feature description.\n\n- Being a startup founder is a very valuable experience. I was the one who decide everything, design everything and then responsible for all the success and failure, of mine. I failed many times, to deliver a product user really need, and never be a success startup.\nI have learnt about lean, design thinking, business model ... During that time. Then I become a startup coach to share these knowledge to many startup founder. I have learn that, a good idea is never enough. You need much more than a good idea, even a \"good\" to success.\n\n- in MoMo, again, I have the chance to responsible for success of a whole line of product. I have seen how other product teams work, debate with other PM about how a product development process should be. I have seen my product reach 1mil user active monthly, and even more. Since we have many user, I also learn a lot about data analysis and growth hacking. \nIt is the time that I believe I have became a senior Product Manager.\n\nMaking both good product and viable product never easy. No school in Vietnam teach about being a product manager. I still remember it was my long journey, self learning, struggling, of mine, till the day I feel confident about my skill. I can't guarantee that all my product are good, but I believe that the product development process I apply, is a progressive process, being recommended by many top expert globally.\n\nI always dream about writing a book, a text book, a guide book, the first and handbook. for all the one who want to be a product manager.

When these two threads needed to communicate, they would use a bridge to send JSON messages back and forth.\nWhile JSON is simple to read, it's not perfect. Imagine running through this diagram a thousand times trying to render all the posts on your friend's Instagram:\nIt's okay JSON, you would be perfect if you handled trailing commasNow, the new architecture lets you skip the JSON middle man and your Javascript can talk directly to native code using a JavaScript Interface, or JSI for short.\nNothing will keep us apartC++ joins the crew\nTo help support JSI, C++ has now entered the React Native stack. Native code for iOS, Android, and beyond can be written in one language and abstract away platform specific details.\nFor those of us who are not C++ developers and would prefer to continue to write native code in an already supported language like Java or Objective C, React Native provides code generation at build time to scaffold the necessary types and methods in native land for our JS code to be able to reference. \nMeta has provided documentation on how to leverage JSI when writing native modules by using Turbo Modules.\nFabric instead of Paper\nIn order to support the concurrent features in React 18, React Native has a new layout engine called Fabric. The old layout engine is sometimes unofficially refered to as \"Paper\".\nThere are a lot of underlying changes to the render paradigm, but one of the most important ones that Fabric enables is the idea of high priority updates.\nSometimes a component renders slowly. Maybe that component needs to do an expensive calculation that is unavoidable. Previously, all you could do would be profile the component tree and try to fix or memoize whatever was rendering slowly. Performance issues like this this can be time consuming to pin down, and solutions for them may require large changes to your app.\nExample from useTransition reference on beta.react.orgNotice how the UI here is unresponsive when trying to trigger other updates while the SlowPosts component is rendering. We are not able to navigate to another page by clicking on the Contact button until it finishes rendering. That is because all updates to the component tree before React 18 have the same priority. The tree must wait until all the components are done rendering before a new component tree can be created and show the updated state.\nExample from useTransition reference on beta.react.orgNotice how the UI immediately changes after clicking on Contact instead of waiting for Posts to finish rendering? By wrapping the state update inuseTransition, it now has higher priority than the existing component tree and will interupt the current render to transition to a new component tree.\nMany developers use high-end devices to test their applications, so they may not run into issues with their UI being unresponsive in development. However, on lower end devices, transitions will be a useful tool to help user interfaces be responsive even during expensive renders, such as long lists.\nThat's cool, what's next?\nI'm a nerd and want to understand more deeply what's going on here\nhttps://reactnative.dev/architecture/overviewThe React Native team has provided detailed documentation regarding important topics like: Architecture Overview, The New Architecture, and Migrating to the New Architecture. However, that can be a lot of information to digest at once, so we would recommend starting with the following articles:\nFabric, React Native's new rendering system.\nTurbo Native Modules\nCreating a New Architecture App\nMigrating to the New Architecture\n\nhttps://github.com/reactwg/react-native-new-architecture/If you want to get your hands dirty and see the bleeding edge, React has a working group for discussing topics related to the new architecture. As it evolves, this is a good place to leave feedback and see other people's experience working with the new architecture.\nFor the video lovers, here are some of our favorite talks for learning more about new architecture:\nThe New Architecture is Here… What Now? - Lorenzo Sciandra - React Native London September 2022Lorenzo Sciandra, one of our favorite React Native maintainers (don't tell the others 😘), talks about some of the core concepts regarding the new architecture and identifies some of the challenges developers will face in the coming years.\nBringing the New React Native Architecture to the OSS community - N. Corti | React Native EU 2022Nicola Corti, a React Native Core team member at Meta, gives a good overview of the timeline for the new architecture rollout both interally at Meta and for the greater React Native community. He also touches on why the React Native team decided this new architecture was necessary, the core pillars of the new architecture, and more. \nWill TurboModules replace JSI Modules - Marc Rousavy - React Native London - June 2022Marc Rousavy, maintainer of react-native-mmkv and other React Native libraries, talks about Turbo Modules and how he decided to utilize JSI outside of Turbo Modules.\nI need to update my existing app\nReact Native New Architecture SampleWe all know that upgrading React Native versions can sometimes be challenging. Thankfully, this repository from react-native-community has step-by-step guides to migrate apps from various versions: such as 0.67 to 0.68, 0.67 to 0.69, 0.67 to 0.70, etc. \nReact Native DirectoryCurious of the compatability of your favorite library? React Native Directory to the rescue! They have a search filter for \"Supports New Architecture\" when looking up libraries.\nhttps://reactnative.dev/docs/new-architecture-introTo help with upgrades, React Native has provided a series of feature flags in order to allow developers to update their app's React Native version and opt into specific features like Turbo Modules, Fabric, or React 18 on their own timeline.\nIt is possible for you to upgrade all of these today following the React Native docs. But as of writing this, Turbo Modules and Fabric are still experimental and being iterated on. You can manually enable them starting in 0.68, but in future releases much of these manual steps will be made simpler through tools, templates and libraries.\nHere is a rough outline of what will be required:\nUpdate to at least 0.68 for Turbo Modules and Fabric\nMake sure Hermes is enabled \nEnable Turbo Module support on iOS and Android through feature flags and added native code.\nEnable Fabric support on iOS and Android through feature flags and added native code.\nUpdate to 0.69 in order to take advantage of React 18 concurrent features like startTransition and useDeferedValue.\n\nI need to update my library\nProbably the trickiest part of the transition from the old architecture to the new architecture will land on the shoulders of library maintainers. \nTwitter Thread from @mateusz1913Mateusz Mędrek, maintainer of react-native-avoid-softinput, wrote a thread on Twitter describing his experience migrating his library in September of 2022.\nPart of our motivation at Infinite Red for this article is to make it easier for library authors and app developers alike to make the leap together.\nhttps://github.com/react-native-community/RNNewArchitectureLibrariesThankfully, React Native Community on GitHub has a repository with step-by-step guides for authoring libraries with Turbo Module and native components utilizing the Fabric rendering system.\nAs people transition, maintainers will essentally have two entry points into their libraries: one for the old architecture and one for the new architecture. They will be able to read the provided feature flags in iOS podfiles and Android gradle files to determine which entrypoints to activate for Turbo Modules and Fabric enabled components.\nI want to start a new app using the new architecture\nhttps://reactnative.dev/docs/the-new-architecture/use-app-templateLuckily, if you are creating a new app as of 0.70, all of the native Android and iOS code changes necessary to enable Turbo Modules, Fabric, Hermes, and React 18 will already be provided by in the app template from React Native CLI. You can test it out yourself by runningnpx react-native init AwesomeProject. Afterwards, you will you need to turn on a series of feature flags described in the docs. \nExpo SDK 47 announcement postIf you want to get started with Expo, Expo SDK 47 has support for React Native 0.70 and Hermes out of the box, along with experimental support for Fabric in many of their libraries.\nNotably, Expo has decided to implement their own support for JSI through their own tool, Expo Modules, instead of using Turbo Modules. \nI want to start a new library that supports the new architecture\nFor bare workflow apps, React Native has provided guides on their docs for creating new Turbo Module libraries and Fabric compatible components.\nhttps://reactnative.dev/docs/the-new-architecture/pillars-turbomoduleshttps://reactnative.dev/docs/the-new-architecture/pillars-fabric-componentsAnother interesting option is to utilize Expo Modules, which boast allowing you to author your native code in Swift and Kotlin, which may be friendlier to more React Native developers than Java and Objective-C++.\nhttps://docs.expo.dev/modules/module-api/#examplesIt is worth noting that it is possible to author Turbo Modules in Kotlin and Swift, but this is not documented in the offical React Native docs as of writing this.\nNeed more?\nInfinite Red is hosting Chain React 2023, the premier React Native conference, May 17–19, 2023 in Portland Oregon.

This initiative aligns with the district's vision of getting students enrolled, enlisted, or employed after high school by showing them how they can use mathematics in their post-high school careers. The initiative will address the needs of diverse learners, including the Black, Latino, and Indian populations, and initial implementation will be inclusive of the 9th-grade Mathematics 1 course.\nTo determine the greatest areas of need and to choose a curricular initiative that would address the need, I will collaborate with building and district leaders and stakeholders. We will use data from the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 9th-grade students to show the benefits of the new curriculum model. We will use PSAT data from fall to spring and NWEA data to compare student performance. This initiative addresses the school-wide need of improving student achievement in math.\nWe will implement this program using a workshop collaborative format through a 6-week Summer Content Development Institute. The team will consist of 16 9th-grade math teacher volunteers from the schools in the district. The cost will be approximately $7,680, which includes $40 per hour for teacher workshop rate, 2 hours of work time per week for 6 weeks, and the cost associated with purchasing the program materials. Professional development will be necessary to ensure that all instructional staff implements the initiative with fidelity.\nAs a school leader with a math curriculum focus, I will collaborate with the director of curriculum and instruction in determining curricular programming needs for the school. I will advocate for the needs of my school and request individualization or customization regarding the curricular program chosen by my group to meet the unique needs of my building. I will also ensure that standards-based assessment systems are used to determine the effectiveness of the curricular initiative, and the data gathered from the assessments will be used to inform internal and external audiences about the effectiveness of the curricular initiative.\nHigh school mathematics education in many traditional classrooms with lectures, worksheets, quizzes, and tests is often viewed as dull and disconnected from students' lives outside the classroom. This approach can result in students missing the connections between mathematics and their daily lives, leading them to undervalue the importance of mathematics in their future careers and democratic participation. This trend of mathematical illiteracy is particularly prevalent among Black, Latino, and Indian populations. To address this issue, this paper proposes a curriculum initiative that focuses on Culturally Responsive Teaching in Mathematics to improve student achievement and promote the use of mathematics in post-high school careers.\nThis trend of mathematical illiteracy can be attributed to \"number numbness,\" a view that mathematics is only relevant in math classes and is not important to students' lives outside the classroom (Peterson, 2006). This perspective results from historic problems with math instruction, such as rote calculations, drill and practice, endless worksheets, and a focus on finding the \"right answer\" (Peterson, 2006). The separation of math from other subjects and from students' daily lives is also a contributing factor (Peterson, 2006). This isolation leads students to view math as only relevant for future math classes, disconnected from their social reality, and irrelevant to their future careers and democratic participation. However, math is a tool for understanding and interacting with the world and other academic disciplines (Peterson, 2006).\nTo address this issue, the proposed curriculum initiative will incorporate social justice issues into the math curriculum, making it relevant and engaging for students. The key to selecting social justice issues to address is to ensure they are culturally relevant to students' lives (Ukpokodu, 2011; Moses, 2002). African-American students have traditionally been underserved in terms of culturally relevant math education (Tate, 2006). By providing opportunities for African-American students to connect mathematics to their lives, they can fully participate in our democracy and critique injustices with math (Gutstein, 2006).\nThe proposed initiative will be implemented using a workshop collaborative format through a 6-week Summer Content Development Institute. Sixteen 9th-grade math teacher volunteers from the district's schools will participate, with a workshop rate of $40 per hour for 2 hours of work time per week for 6 weeks. The cost will also include program materials for a total of approximately $8,200. \nThe proposed initiative focusing on Culturally Responsive Teaching in Mathematics will address the needs of diverse learners and align with the district's vision of preparing students for post-high school careers. By using a workshop collaborative format, all instructional staff will have the opportunity to participate in the development of the new curriculum model, ensuring that the initiative is implemented with fidelity. Incorporating social justice issues into the math curriculum will make it relevant and engaging for students, improving their achievement in mathematics and promoting the use of mathematics in post-high school careers.\nThe success of the initiative will be demonstrated by improvements in PSAT and NWEA data, as well as student engagement and feedback. By providing opportunities for students to connect mathematics to their lives and social reality, they will view math as a tool for understanding and interacting with the world and other academic disciplines, leading to a more mathematically literate population.\n\nShare Prompt"}

Please do this without erasing any of the facts or details in the essay. \n\nthe essay: Far East of New York in Bermuda lies one of North America’s most influential nations and island countries, New Pangea. The country holds promising social achievements as well as many economic and technological accomplishments that have been recognized internationally for nearly centuries. \n\nThe island country was once exclusively inhabited by its natives referred to as “Kraenons”. Despite their lack of appearance in any historical events with other countries before their English encounters, the Kraenons were fully capable of creating their own technology and advanced mathematics (Though interestingly, there have been no accounts of the Kraenons seeking out foreign civilization before they were discovered). After merging a large majority of the population with English settlers over nearly a century, a newly formed Pangean culture would take hold of the country. Pangean culture amalgamates many aspects of 1600s English and Kraenon culture such as the Kraenon “Bristle week” and English “Christmas”. Pangeans hold a deeply devotional respect for birds, it is not uncommon to find residents of the country preparing bird seeds for native birds to feast. Over the 20th century, New Pangea experienced massive influence from western and European cultures, especially in technology and architecture such as the popularity of the telephone and television as well as homes with white exteriors and rectangular windows. Among the many cultural practices in New Pangea, one of the most followed and respected values in families and communities across the country are the benefits and regard for education, education is commonly viewed as the only path to success within the general population. New Pangea’s educational philosophy is taken seriously even by the youth of the country who view subjects such as math or science as challenging entertainment rather than a forced subject of no interest. \n\nDue to New Pangea's deep cultural beliefs in education, schools across the country receive up to 20% of the country’s yearly budget, or up to 100,000,000 PAN (125,000,000 CAD). Due to New Pangea's comparatively high wealth:population ratio when compared to other developed countries, students are offered much higher quality education from much more qualified educators. Many classes in Pangean schools are held outdoors to maintain the mental state of students while they learn, homework in the country is also regularly minimized to only long-term projects for certain subjects, keeping students from stress and allowing them to enjoy their time outside of school as well as giving them a task to complete over time. As of 2022, New Pangea’s education has been successful enough to maintain a 1250 SAT score average as well as a 84% college/university graduation rate among the population above the age of 24.\n\nAs well as high cultural regard for education, families in New Pangea show respect through a variety of customs and practices. Pangeans are expected to bow when greeted in consideration of others, especially their parents or the elderly. It is also expected that Pangeans respect and obey their parents. In addition to many practices of social courtesy and belief, Pangeans follow a strict philosophy of respect for their natural environment. Socially unaccepted yet foreignly common bad habits in this regard such as littering or vandalizing are disputed as contentious and controversial, this etiquette is largely believed to be owed to the nation's vast reverence for birds of the country’s wild. The population's cultural connection with nature has also given a noticeable impact on the laws in the country. In 2008, the New Pangea National Congress would pass the “New Atomica” bill, which would successfully demolish the use of fossil fuels nationwide by 97.4% by 2015, the countries main source of energy since and before has been nuclear energy sourced from Atomica Industries, raising safety concerns which have yet to be dealt with. In 2014, New Pangea National Congress would then pass the “Green Pangea” bill which would mandate recycling bins to be put across the country, as well as basic education on recycling waste in both public and private schools.\n\nThe living standards of New Pangea are comparably higher in comparison with other developed nations. All youth are legally required and provided to participate in the country’s education which has been ranked the highest globally by organizations such as the Global Citizens For Human Rights. The social democratic system implemented into New Pangea’s economy allows even the lowest financial classes of the country to be provided with a healthy amount of food and water as well as shelter and healthcare all without the burden of financial stress. Because of these factors, the people of New Pangea live comfortable lives where their health is almost always independent of their class. Children in the country do not have to work to provide for their families financially, allowing children in New Pangea to be given time for study, creativity and entertainment. Adults in New Pangea are driven to work by and for the nation’s capitalist economy in order to afford the luxuries (food, homes, technology…) provided by the economy. For the less fortunate, the government provides centralized but rationed food, water and shelter as well as fully covered healthcare. Though it is more common to live in privately owned properties, New Pangea’s government offers tax-paid shelters called “Government Residential Buildings” to the homeless population, though these homes are not considered luxurious or even comfortable for some, it meets the mental and physical standards for those who choose to live in them. The typical middle class worker in New Pangea works from morning (9-11AM) to evening (6-9PM) and is paid on average 24.5 CAD an hour, more than enough to be both financially stable and mentally comfortable in the country’s economy.\n\nThe economy of New Pangea is fueled by the country’s 3 big industries, the Seafood industry, Mining industry and Technology industry. Just like other Island countries, New Pangea is the home of some of the world's most exotic and profitable seafood businesses, namely “Jontora seafoods”, the world's largest seafood company which made approximately 45,000,000,000 CAD in 2022 (Though the company originated in New Pangea, it has many sister locations put internationally). The Seafood industry in New Pangea also contributes to the country’s alluring tourist industry which made 70,000,000,000 CAD in 2022. The biggest driving factors of New Pangea’s economic growth are the country’s mining and technology industry. Since the 1960s, Atomica Industries (which is government owned) has been mining tonnes of uranium among other valuable minerals in Morriloe Island, creating a net profit of 400,176,100 CAD from mining alone in 2022. Atomica Industries as well as other Pangean companies such as Mei-Plye-technologies have accounted for the country’s technological advancements in Nuclear technology, Medical technology and AI/computer technology. Technological exports from the country made net profit of approximately 1,000,000,000,000 CAD in only 2022, this is largely owed to the country’s abundance of metal from Morriloe Island as well as a national emphasis on education. In recent years, technology has seen a steep improvement worldwide, opening an opportunity for the already thriving tech industry of New Pangea to blossom in now growing fields such as quantum computing, AI technology and more."}

{"text": "Below is the text of a news article. Please write a 5-sentence summary, focused on the factual content and removing any sensationalism or anxiety-inducing content:\n\nIt is the latest stunning barrier shattered by the nation’s most unruly president. And it means that after a tumultuous four-year term, a historic two impeachments, an election falsely tainted by Trump’s lies about fraud and a mob attack by his supporters on Congress, a new national nightmare may be ahead.\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 22: U.S. President Donald Trump exits the Oval Office and walks to Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House on September 22, 2020 in Washington, DC. President Trump is traveling to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for a campaign event. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\nTrump has been indicted. Here's what happens next in court\nIn a momentous step Thursday, a Manhattan grand jury voted to indict Trump on what sources said were more than 30 counts related to business fraud in a case arising from hush money paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels, possibly to defuse a scandal ahead of the 2016 election.\n\nThere is nothing in American history that approaches the tumult of the charging and possible trial and conviction of a former president – especially since Trump and his supporters are already claiming that the indictment represents the weaponized politicization of the justice system.\n\n“We have been close before (but) we have never been at this point,” John Dean, former President Richard Nixon’s Watergate-era special counsel, told CNN. “No prior president – former, sitting or otherwise – has ever been indicted.”\n\nGiven the extreme national political estrangement exacerbated by Trump, this case is likely to leave the country changed however it turns out. There will be fears, for instance, that it will crush one of the last remaining precedents for political restraint and leave future presidents vulnerable to prosecution in a manner more akin to fragile failing states than the world’s most vital democracy. Yet at the same time, if Trump has indeed committed crimes, a failure to pursue him would send a message that the powerful can get away with behavior that ordinary Americans cannot.\n\nThe move was especially stunning given Trump’s long record of impunity, which has seen him constantly stretch the limits of the law and the conventions of accepted behavior with his uproarious personal, business and political careers. Suddenly, Trump’s decades of evading accountability will end. The former president will have to start answering for his conduct, likely beginning in court on Tuesday after he travels to New York to be arraigned in what will be a high-security spectacle given his past incitement of violence.\n\nTrump launches a furious counter-attack\nTrump insists he is innocent of all allegations, in this case as well as in several others that may pose even greater legal peril, including special counsel investigations into his hoarding of classified documents and his conduct around the 2020 election and a separate Georgia investigation into his bid to steal the election in the swing state.\n\nThe ex-president quickly showed he’s ready to drive the country into a deep political crisis as he mounts his defense with wild claims of persecution. He accused Democrats of weaponizing justice to thwart his 2024 White House bid – a claim that threatens to shatter the credibility of the next election in the eyes of millions of his followers and further damage US democracy.\n\n“This is an attack on our country the likes of which has never been seen before,” Trump wrote in block capitals on his Truth Social network. “It is likewise a continuing attack on our once free and fair elections. The USA is now a third world nation, a nation in serious decline. So sad!”\n\nLike all Americans accused of crimes, Trump is entitled to the presumption of innocence and his full rights under the Constitution, which he tried to overturn on January, 6, 2021. The perception of this extraordinary case will turn on two questions fundamental to the credibility of American justice: Are all citizens – even the most powerful, like former presidents and White House candidates – considered equal under the law? Or is Trump being singled out because of who he is?\n\nThe indictment voted by the grand jury remains under seal, so the exact charges and the extent of evidence against him remain unclear. But many legal experts have questioned whether a case possibly alleging fraudulent accounting and subsequent infringements of election law would rise to the magnitude that might justify the nation-shaking act of indicting a former president and frontrunner for the 2024 GOP nomination. Some observers have warned against a case that might rely heavily on the testimony of former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, who made the payments to Daniels and has already served a jail sentence for charges that included lying to Congress.\n\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy speaks during a Friends of Ireland caucus St. Patrick's Day luncheon at the Capitol in Washington on Friday, March 17.\nRepublican leaders and Trump loyalists on Capitol Hill rally behind the former president after indictment\nEven if there is plentiful evidence that makes this a relatively simple sell to a jury, the fame and the power of the defendant means the case will unfold in a court of public opinion. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is under enormous pressure since if he fails to secure a conviction, he will be accused even more than he already is of building a politicized case that could tear gaping new divides in the country.\n\nTrump’s most fervent supporters in the House of Representatives lambasted Bragg despite having not seen the charges or evidence against the former president. The angry reactions were consistent with Trump’s previous attempts to intimidate Bragg, which were set off nearly two weeks ago with his inaccurate prediction that he’d be arrested early last week. The strategy was clearly designed to prejudice public opinion against the case before Trump even appears in court and to energize the former president’s grassroots supporters and the conservative media machine.\n\n“Outrageous” was the only comment issued by House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan of Ohio, one of the ex-president’s most staunch loyalists.\n\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy tweeted, “The American people will not tolerate this injustice,” and added that “The House of Representatives will hold Alvin Bragg and his unprecedented abuse of power to account” – a comment that appeared to indicate a fresh attempt to use government power to interfere in an active case going through America’s independent legal system.\n\nThe No. 2 House Republican – Majority Leader Steve Scalise – called the indictment “one of the clearest examples of extremist Democrats weaponizing government to attack their political opponents.” Rep. Elise Stefanik, the House GOP conference chair, released a statement saying the indictment was “a political witch hunt” and a “dark day for America.” There was no immediate comment, however, from Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, underscoring the divides in the GOP over Trump’s past assault on American democracy and political aspirations.\n\nIndictment shakes up 2024 White House race\nIt is too early to predict how voters, in the GOP primary or in the national electorate, will respond to Trump’s indictment. And it is also unclear whether a possible trial would take place before the 2024 election or where the multiple other investigations into Trump’s conduct will be by then.\n\nBut Thursday’s historic news out of Manhattan immediately scrambled the GOP nominating contest.\n\nThe move forced the ex-president’s potential Republican rivals into hurried condemnations to preserve their own viability among GOP voters.\n\n“I think the unprecedented indictment of a former president of the United States on a campaign finance issue is an outrage,” former Vice President Mike Pence told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer in an interview. “It appears to millions of Americans to be nothing more than a political prosecution that’s driven by a prosecutor who literally ran for office on a pledge to indict the former president.”\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks at Christopher Columbus High School on Monday, March 27, 2023, in Miami. \nPotential 2024 GOP field responds to Trump indictment by attacking Bragg\nTrump blames Pence for failing to intervene in Congress’ certification of President Joe Biden’s election victory – a position that may limit the former vice president’s political ceiling in a party still filled with Trump loyalists.\n\nAny immediate political boost Trump is able to engineer from the indictment could harm his potential strongest primary rival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Like other potential candidates, DeSantis had no political room to do anything other than condemn the indictment – even though he has been portraying himself as a potential president who would be far more calm, methodical and effective in implementing a hardline conservative agenda than Trump was.\n\nBut DeSantis also made an extraordinary threat that if Trump were to resist turning himself in, he would refuse to participate in any attempt by New York to extradite him – a move that, if it happened, could precipitate a constitutional crisis.\n\n“The weaponization of the legal system to advance a political agenda turns the rule of law on its head. It is un-American,” DeSantis tweeted. “Florida will not assist in an extradition request given the questionable circumstances at issue with this Soros-backed Manhattan prosecutor and his political agenda.”\n\nThe Florida governor’s threat was just one ill omen that suggests the months ahead will be divisive and dangerous to America’s democracy – whether Trump is found guilty or not."}
{"text": "We have the following blog content... what is the likely user intent of a searcher who lands on this page? Our goal should be to answer that intent better and faster than anyone else!\n\nThe content:\n\nConsumers want more choices, but all those choices can be daunting. It gives the consumer the responsibility of educating themselves on the best option for their circumstances. On GigSalad, we deliver more than 600 categories of entertainment and event services for the ability to compare rates of various performers. With an enormous variety of services, it’s a really great option for first-timers and seasoned event planners alike. But with so many talented professionals out there, how do you choose? Budget may be a large factor in who you choose to book, but before you make your choice, here are 6 reasons for choosing the best entertainment, not the cheapest.\n\n1. You get what you pay for.\nEntertainers with higher rates oftentimes need to charge more to account for the costs of their high-quality equipment. Many performers set them based on their professional experience. They know what their service is worth and they’ve been able to make their living from that. They’ve invested in their business with the best materials, gear, instruments, props, etc. to give their clients most immersive experience. These materials can make a huge difference between one vendor and another.\n\nSay you’re looking for a princess character for your child’s birthday party. To make a fairy tale come to life, performers need costumes and accessories that not only look pretty and authentic but also hold up to wear and tear. Along with the costs of dry cleaning, well-made costumes are a large investment for professional princess characters. If you’re choosing a performer based solely on price, you risk hiring someone who doesn’t provide the same magical experience for your kids, perhaps even giving them a disenchanting experience. A top-notch entertainer will deliver a performance that you and your family will remember for years to come.\n\n \n \n\nDon’t let the sticker shock of good entertainment throw off your plans. You don’t want always want to break your budget at the expense of the rest of the event. Simply determine your priorities and set the spending from there. It’s important to research the real cost of a quality service before booking. If there is a significant drop-off between bids, then you can probably expect a drop-off in quality as well. Adjust your budget to your talent and quality expectations.\n\n2. Professionals who are invested in their business are also invested in their clients.\nWhen performers rely heavily on your business for their income, they’ll go to great lengths to make sure you’re happy with their service. Most of our GigSalad entertainers are self-employed, independent business people. They depend on good reviews and word of mouth for promotion and buzz.\n\nHiring an experienced professional means you’re hiring someone who has invested their lives into entertaining. Their goal is to make a living and provide you with a memorable event at the same time. Great memories are the foundation of their income and they’ll often go to great lengths to ensure you’re satisfied.\n\n3. Pros know how to customize for your needs.\nMany low-cost entertainers and performers are at the beginning of their careers or at a lower skill level. Often, this means that they offer a limited repertoire and fewer options as they are developing their craft. Your event is unique to you, therefore, you’ll need someone who can customize their act or services to your event. A good sign of a professional is their ability and willingness to reasonably adapt to your event needs.\n\n4. Pros offer more than just entertainment. They give you peace of mind.\nProfessionals who charge more than the competition have the confidence in their experience. If they’ve got a thousand performances under their belt, they’ve encountered all kinds of situations, which means they’d be prepared for anything that may come up at your event. The ability to adapt and improvise is especially beneficial in unexpected situations that put your event at risk of turning into a disaster!\n5. The difference in cost makes all the difference in the success of your event.\nYou’ve decided to take the risk and hire an entertainer for your event. Perhaps a strolling magician for the office party you were picked to plan. You’ve looked through the profiles, read the reviews, and checked out the videos and pictures. When the moment of decision comes, the temptation of saving a few bucks by hiring someone with fewer reviews and a lower quality presentation get very real very quickly. That’s money that could go to streamers! But those few dollars could mean the difference in the quality of your event and the likelihood of using entertainment again. A great professional turns the groans of “Remember last year? I hope that doesn’t happen again,” to the excitement of “Remember last year? I can’t wait to see what happens this time!” Paying a few extra bucks can prevent the dreaded buyer’s remorse.\n\n6. There are no do-overs.\nGigSalad’s mission is to help you Book Something Awesome. We recognize that many of the events we connect entertainers with are often once in a lifetime moments. That significance is one of the reasons we encourage you to take the time and research your providers well. You may not get a chance to do it again. We hope that you would take the few extra minutes necessary to thoroughly read the bids, examine the profiles, view the media, and make an educated decision. Don’t risk devaluing a critical life moment or celebration by going bargain hunting. If the price is right and the quality is high, invest in the memory. \n\nWe’re not telling you that you should choose only vendors who charge more for their services. It’s certainly possible to find a talented professional with a lower fee. We’re simply encouraging you to do your homework. Look at their photos and videos, read reviews, ask them questions. Figure out why their rates are what they are. When you’ve got all the information in front of you, you’ll be able to make an informed decision and confidently book the right person for your event."}

Observation February 2, 2023, 8:00 am - 8:50 am \n\n8:00 am a student comes to the board right away and presents a problem that they had for homework. Students in class give the first student at the board their full attention. \n\n \n\nTeacher asks student at the board a follow up question to solidify the answer. \n\nTeacher then asks an open ended question to the class. \n\nTwo students provide responses. \n\nA student enters late by about 1 minute. They enter and promptly take their seat. They engage with the lesson right away. \n\nA second student goes to the board and presents a problem. \n\n8:04 am Teacher tells the class that there is an error and asks if any one can find it. Teacher gives wait time. \n\nThe student at the board identifies the error and shares it with the class. \n\nTeacher then asked the student a follow-up question about squaring the diameter. \n\n8:06 am the third student comes to the board. Presents problem from 5.7 homework on definite integers. \n\nThe teacher asks “Any questions, any issues?” to the class. \n\n \n\nPhysical environment: There are 6 math puzzle posters in the front of the classroom. Desks are in rows. There is a trophy case with many awards on the side of the room. \n\n \n\n8:27 am student contributes to example on area of a circle and area of a washer. \n\n8:29 am “Any thoughts about that?” Teacher asks to the class, and then gives wait time. \n\nA student volunteers an answer. \n\n8:32 am A student says that the area of a washer is the area of the bigger circle minus the area of the smaller circle. \n\nTeacher then writes the formula associated with those values on the board. \n\n8:34 am Teacher asks students about integrating the area of a circle. \n\nTeacher goes to a new slide and begins writing an example. \n\n8:35 am Teacher begins a think aloud saying “ok, now what do I do?” He then asks the class a question connecting this lesson to the prior lesson “ what was the 1st thing that we did yesterday?” \n\nMultiple students reply. \n\n \n\nThe teacher uses technology to present lessons to students. Teacher uses an interactive slideshow program , “Jamboard”, through the interactive white board. Teacher uses a variety of pens and colors to visually distinguish the qualities of examples. The colors also help to differentiate for visual learners. \n\n8:38 am Teacher asks students “what solid is formed from rotating the parabola around the x-axis?” \n\nStudents share answers such as “egg” and “sphere”. \n\nTeacher then says a football shape. \n\n8:44 am Student says that the bounds for the integral are 0 to 3. The student then describes her process for finding that solution. \n\n8:46 am Teacher solves problem with a calculator and writes the solution on the board. \n\n8:47 Teacher writes another example on the board. He then asks “How is this different from the last problem?” \n\nTwo students then reply indicating this problem emphasizes the y-axis."}

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to a variety of shapes and textures, and show that it is able to transfer texture with high fidelity while preserving the underlying geometry of the target shape. Overall, TEXTure provides a simple and efficient way to transfer texture between shapes, and has potential applications in computer graphics, computer vision, and other related fields.\""}

The company offers\nbespoke software solutions to its clients and has built a strong reputation for delivering its\nproducts on time since its establishment.\nThe company maintains a pool of employees of different levels and expertise, ranging from\ndomain analysts and software engineers to web developers and graphic designers. After\nan agreement on developing a new software solution for a client, the company's\nmanagement team uses the pool above to form and propose a new project team to\nundertake the development.

You are asked to\ndesign a database that is in the third normal form (3NF), and can be used to store the\nfollowing information:\n1. For clients: organisation name, contact first and last name, email and address, as\nwell as the preferred method of contact (by post or via email).\n2. For pool members: first and last name, contact email and phone number, work\nand home address.\n3. For pool members' skills: skill name and type, e.g.:\nname=\"Java\", type=\"Backend\" or name=“JUnit”, type=“Testing”. Note that you are\nexpected to use your own combinations of values when you insert data into the\ndatabase.\n4. For projects: title, start date, end date, budget, a short description and the phase.\nSuggested values for the phase are: \"design\", \"development\", \"testing\",\n\"deployment\" and \"complete\".\nEnsure that your database design has meaningful data integrity constraints and\nappropriate foreign-key constraints.

{"text": "ou were providing an updated version of the code that implements a deep reinforcement learning-based item recommendation system for Teamfight Tactics, incorporating some of the improvements discussed such as:Hyperparameter tuning: The hyperparameters such as the learning rate, discount factor, and exploration rate (epsilon) can be tuned to optimize the performance of the agent. A grid search or a random search could be used to find the optimal values.\n\nModel architecture: The DRLModel class defines the neural network architecture used by the DQN. However, the current architecture is quite simple and may not be optimal for playing Teamfight Tactics. A more complex and sophisticated architecture such as a convolutional neural network or a recurrent neural network could be used to improve the performance of the agent.\n\nReplay memory: The current implementation uses a simple list as the replay memory. However, this can be quite inefficient and slow as the size of the memory grows. An efficient data structure such as a deque or a prioritized replay buffer could be used to improve the performance of the agent.\n\nExploration strategy: The current implementation uses an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy. However, this can be improved by using a more sophisticated exploration strategy such as Boltzmann exploration or the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm.\n\nTransfer learning: The agent could potentially benefit from pretraining on a similar task or using the weights of a pre-trained model as a starting point. This could speed up the training process and improve the performance of the agent.\n\nModel evaluation: The code does not currently include any mechanism for evaluating the performance of the model. A validation set or a test set could be used to evaluate the performance of the agent and ensure that it is not overfitting to the training data."}

{"text": "Below are questions and answers from an interview with the CEO of ‘Plastic Arc’, a Cafe24 customer.\nBased on the information below, please write content to be posted on the Cafe24 blog from the perspective of the brand's growth process.\n\nQ: Please tell us the meaning of your brand name.\nAnswer: Ark means Noah's Ark. In a world overflowing with plastic waste, the end of the world is drawing near. So we got the name because we said we would melt this plastic and make a plastic ark to save mankind.\n\nQ: Please tell us how and when you started creating an online shopping mall.\nA: Through the documentary, I realized that environmental problems are much more serious than I thought. One day, thinking that it could have an impact on the end of my life, I decided to take action. Plastic trash is overflowing, but I started a business using waste plastic because I thought I could make a small change with this plastic, which is always around me.\n\nQ: Please tell us about the products you sell and your business overview.\nA: I tried to make environmental protection a cultural trend in order to approach people who are not interested in environmental issues in a friendly way. Since there is nothing that can create a culture as quickly as fashion culture, we are developing a brand by combining fashion. Wanting recycled plastic products to be used closely in daily life, it started as a planter item, launched a cell phone case, and plans to expand to pet products in the future.\n\nQ: What was the hardest thing about running an online shopping mall and how did you overcome it?\nA: It was very difficult to manufacture and commercialize without any expertise in plastics. Waste plastic design pattern technology was a technology that did not exist before, so R&D was almost impossible. I tend to come here on my own, so I translated, read, and studied overseas papers, and I was convinced that it was possible. In the process, I made samples myself and suffered burns all over my body, but I met a company that said it was possible and was able to produce products.\n\nQ: Can you tell us your company's growth story, including key metrics like revenue and membership?\nAnswer: In addition to consumers and followers who were interested in environmental protection, we are experiencing an increase in interest in brands, such as other brands recently taking an interest in plastic arc. Recently, as famous celebrities use Plastic Ark's products, the brand is growing further.\n\nQuestion: What advice would you give to someone starting an online shopping mall?\nAnswer: If you have a desire to do something in your heart, I hope you do it as a movement or as an action, even if it is not necessarily a business. That way, you will not have any regrets later.\n\nQ: How do you differentiate yourself from competing brands?\nA: We are manufacturing products with technology that implements a certain design (pattern) with waste plastic.\nQ: What is the company's future growth strategy and expansion plans?\nAnswer:- The mission of the brand is not simply to produce products by recycling waste plastic, but to achieve the circulation of resources. If you send Plastic Arc products or general plastic containers to Plastic Arc, we operate a reward program that accumulates points on the Plastic Arc website, and we want to activate this. If there is a place where a lot of plastic is consumed and can be collected, such as schools or apartments, we plan to carry out a collaborative project.\n\nQ: Do you have plans to go abroad?\nAnswer: At the start of the business, overseas sales were considered as the focus, but it was held due to various variables (Corona, Ukraine). In the future, Cafe24 plans to carry out full-fledged overseas sales through the English website."}

They face long-distance challenges as Alex travels frequently for work, and they struggle to find time for each other. They also encounter cultural differences, as Maya comes from a different background and upbringing than Alex. They sometimes struggle to understand each other's perspectives and values, but they work through their differences with patience, empathy, and open communication.\nIn addition, there are external factors that make their relationship more challenging. Alex's ex-girlfriend, who he had a tumultuous relationship with, tries to sabotage their relationship by spreading rumors and lies about Maya. Maya's job becomes more demanding, and she is forced to work long hours and weekends, leaving her with little time and energy for Alex.\nDespite these challenges, Alex and Maya persevere. They lean on each other for support, and their love for each other continues to grow stronger. They celebrate their victories together and comfort each other during their defeats. They learn to compromise and make sacrifices for each other, and they come to value and respect each other's differences.\nEventually, after months of dating, Alex and Maya decide to take their relationship to the next level.

{"text": "The Pirate Bay's switch to magnet links instead of torrent files and what it changes in the big picture. I always used to download the .torrent files, because it was easier to exclude things like sample videos and dumb usenet group txt files from certain videos, or pick out parts of a HUGE torrent that you want. Because the .torrent contains information about what you're getting. With magnets you have to wait for the file list to load and then dick around with it. This is mostly a client issue, I realize, and I could probably work around it myself. uTorrent will probably default to a setting that lets you do this transparently sometime. Still, it's a tiny inconvenience, so what is gained?"}

In their influential book \"The Meaning of Meaning\" (1923), Ogden and Richards introduced the idea of the \"semantic triangle,\" which consists of the symbol (the word or sign), the referent (the object or concept the symbol represents), and the thought or reference (the mental image or concept associated with the symbol). They argued that meaning arises from the complex interplay between these three elements, emphasizing the role of context and individual interpretation in shaping word meanings."}

He has a loud, deep voice, and has more confidence than he has intelligence. He wants to be friends with his colleague exam invigilator John Thompson, so often tries and fails to impress him with his elaborate stories. He often bangs on about how he presents the school talent show. He can often be found using disabled toilets for hours on end, despite no obvious disability. Andy wears a white shirt, which has some embarrassing stains.\n\nJohn is a 69 year old man with plenty of money, as he is past retirement it is unusual that he is working as an exam invigilator but we suspect it might be that he is trying to impress his manager, Carol Yapp. John has wispy, grey hair and wears a pinstripe suit, several gold rings on his wrinkly fingers and red tinted glasses. He makes brazen, inappropriate remarks towards his female colleagues, as if it is acceptable. The students think he is a creepy man, and try to avoid him.\n\nCarol is a 43 year old woman, very serious and astute. She is the chief exams officer. She's generally quite boring, and doesn't speak much, other than to recite rules and regulations. She has curly, brown hair and glasses.\n\nLindsey, a 44 year old woman, is the headteacher of the high school. Her staff, including Andy, John and Carol, are so afraid of her that they barely utter a word when she is in the room. She has been trying to cover up John's predatory behaviour to avoid scrutiny from the school inspectors.\n\nRuth, a 40 year old woman, is a languages teacher at the high school. She is so obsessed with the German language and culture that she regularly speaks to her colleagues in German and they make fun of her for this."}

{"text": "Act as an English teacher for English learners in Korea. Your students are at the intermediate or advanced level. I'll give you a news article. Summarize the article in 250 words. Make 3 multiple-choice reading comprehension questions based on the summary you made. Each question has 4 choices. Each question is followed by an answer. Then give your students a task: writing a summary of your news article summary. Students' summary must be at least 5-sentence long. They should write in English. Give them 10 vocabulary words that will be helpful to complete their summary. Do not give them any writing example. No possible summary needed. They will only have 10 vocabulary words. Here's the news article:\n\nDays after the International Criminal Court issued a warrant for his arrest, Russian President Vladimir Putin made a defiant visit to the city of Mariupol in his first trip to Ukrainian territory that Moscow illegally annexed in September.\n\nPutin flew into the port city by helicopter and “traveled around several districts of the city,” the Kremlin said in a statement Sunday, adding that he met several residents and went into one family's home after they invited him in.\n\nRussia’s Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin said in a separate post on his Telegram channel that Putin “personally inspected one of the residential areas, the building of the Philharmonic Society and assessed the roads, driving a car around the city.”\nUkraine ceded Mariupol to Russia in May, after a monthslong struggle that saw some of the most brutal Russian strikes of the conflict, including an attack on a theater that was serving as the city’s largest bomb shelter and a maternity hospital. Much of the strategic city still lies in ruins after relentless bombardment.\n\nHaving failed to take Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, it was Moscow's first major victory after it's invasion in February.\n\nBut by then the city had become a worldwide symbol of defiance after small group of outgunned Ukrainian fighters held out for 83 days in the sprawling Azovstal steelworks in the east of the city, in one of the war’s longest and bloodiest battles. The fighters dogged defense tied down Russian forces and held up their eastern offensive.\n\nAn estimated 100,000 people remained in the city after its capture out of a pre-war population of 450,000.\n\nKhusnullin said Sunday he had reported to Putin on “the construction of new housing and infrastructure, the improvement of territories, road construction and economic development.”\n\nIn a separate interview with the state-owned news agency RIA Novosti, he said that “people began to return actively” to the city “when they saw that the restoration was going on.”\n\nNBC News could not verify this claim.\n\nIt was Putin’s second unannounced trip of the weekend to Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine. He also traveled to nearby Crimea to mark the ninth anniversary of the Black Sea Peninsula’s annexation from Ukraine.\n\nWhile Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has made a number of trips to battlefields to boost soldier morale, Putin has mainly remained inside the Kremlin throughout the year-long conflict, and his visit to Mariupol was the closest he has been to the front lines since the invasion.\n\nRussia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, a move that most of the world denounced as illegal. Following referendums that Kyiv and the West described as a sham in September, Moscow claimed four regions in Ukraine’s south and east as Russian territory, including Donetsk, where Mariupol is situated. The Kremlin statement said that Putin had also met with the top command of his military operation in Ukraine, including Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov, who is in charge of the war, at the Rostov-on-Don command post in southern Russia.\n\nWhile Putin has largely been exempt from complaints, some of Moscow’s pro-war agitators have seen the nonappearance of senior ministers to the battlefields as evidence they are not strong enough on Ukraine.\n\nHis visits came a day after the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for the Russian leader, accusing him of committing the “war crime” of overseeing the unlawful abduction and deportation of children from Ukraine to Russia.\n\nIt said there were reasonable grounds to believe that Putin bore individual responsibility for the crimes, and that he had failed to exercise proper control over subordinates who committed the acts.\n\nMoscow has consistently denied allegations of war crimes, describing them as a “fantasy” aimed at discrediting Russia. Putin’s press secretary Dmitry Peskov rejected the court’s findings. “We do not recognize this court, we do not recognize the jurisdiction of this court. This is how we treat this,” he said in a Telegram post Friday.\nHowever, “Russia can’t present this as traveling ‘abroad’ in defiance of the ICC,” according to Keir Giles, a senior consulting fellow on Russia and Eurasia at the London think tank Chatham House.\n\n“Crimea and Mariupol are in Ukraine, just temporarily occupied by Russian troops, but to admit that fact would run counter to Moscow’s whole narrative that they should be treated as belonging to Russia,” he said.\n\n“Admitting that a day trip to Mariupol is a visit to a foreign country would also be an admission that Russia has illegally occupied its neighbor,” he added.\n\nElsewhere, Yevgeny Prigozhin, a billionaire oligarch who runs the private army the Wagner Group said Saturday that he plans to recruit 30,000 new fighters by mid-May.\n\n“We have days when we’re recruiting up to 1200 people a day. On average, the number’s oscillating between 500-800 [people] and there’s currently a spike in growth,” Prighozin said in a statement posted to the Russian social media site VK on Saturday.\n\nThe Wagner group previously recruited convicts from Russian prisons but said it had stopped in January. According to figures from the Russian penal service published in November, the country’s prison population dropped by more than 20,000 between August and November, the largest drop in a decade.지금 번역하기"}

{"text": "This is what someone else had to say about this essay and why it worked well, can you summarize this person's opinion in bullet points?\n\nOpinion on why this essay worked well:\nGet clear on the story you’re telling. Debate? Political organizing? Musical theater? Protest music? This writer probably had a lot more to say about all of those experiences. But we don’t get the whole backstory about her journey toward musical theater. Why? Because she’s clear on what this story is about (she may have even written a logline to get that clarity…). We don’t need a lot of context about her decision “not to participate in the musical” because this essay isn’t about her experiences with musical theater; it’s about her forging a new identity by combining seemingly disparate interests (e.g., music and political advocacy). Telling us every musical she’s ever been in won’t help us “get” what she’s saying in this essay (and she has the activities list to tell us that…). Instead, she shows us only the details relevant to her trying to balance a love of music with her newfound interests: she decides “not to participate in the musical,” and she “halts voice and piano lessons.”\n\nBridge the gap (between paragraphs). Stronger essays have paragraphs with clear relationships to one another. This writer uses various phrases to achieve that clarity. When she starts paragraph four with “this introduction,” you understand that she’s referring to her “songs about the Syrian Refugee Crisis” from the end of paragraph three. Similarly, she resolves the problem of her “losing touch” with music at the end of paragraph two by beginning paragraph three by stating she found a “new way of being…” She’s using those key moments of transition to tell her readers: hey, I’m going somewhere with all these ideas, you can trust me.\n\nYou don’t have to have all the answers. When the writer tells us that she sang “Amazing Grace” to honor someone in her community who died by suicide, she gets vulnerable—she says that she still doesn't “fully understand” the effects of that moment. In admitting that she’s still coming to terms with that experience, she comes off as a mature, reasoned person who thinks deeply about lived experience. No one reading your essay is going to expect you to have fully processed every difficult experience you’ve ever had in your life. That would be outrageous. What they will appreciate seeing, though, is that you’ve reflected deeply on lived experiences. Sometimes reflection yields answers. Sometimes it just yields more questions. Either is okay—just don’t feel like you need to have everything figured out to write about it (or that you need to pretend like you do)."}

{"text": "I envision this project supporting all of Jayhawks Rising by designing, collecting, coordinating, presenting and reporting on all relevant data that would inform decisions to see each objective succeed over time, and by leading decisions on a strategic ordering of sub-projects to gain leverage and reinvest those gains on future endeavors. Here is an outline of Jayhawks Rising:\n\nThe university of Kansas has a university-wide mission called Jayhawks Rising. The three mission-based institutional priorities for Jayhawks Rising are “Student Success”, “Healthy and Vibrant Communities”, and “Research and Discovery”. Thirteen objectives were identified under the three priorities. Each objective has co-leaders – deans and vice provosts with responsibilities tied to the objective – who will guide our efforts, involve stakeholders and lead implementation of strategies and action steps and help ensure continuous progress and success. Here is an outline of the thirteen objectives:\nSTUDENT SUCCESS\n· Increase Enrollment: We aim to expand our diverse community of ambitious and talented students, increasing access to a world class education for more first time freshman, new transfers, returning and graduate students. We will expand the reach of KU programming to connect to Jayhawks near and far, through on campus courses, around the nation in virtual formats, and across the globe.\n· Assure Retention and Completion Through Student Engagement and Satisfaction: While student presence, persistence, and performance are indicators of a satisfied student population, it is also meaningful to assess and monitor student engagement and satisfaction directly. Engaged and satisfied students are more likely to retain, ultimately complete, and pass on the message that KU is a fantastic choice for higher education.\n· Support Student Long-Term Success by Improving Placement & Reducing Debt: While earning a degree from KU is part of why students attend KU, what they do with that degree is also of great importance. Additionally, the cost of higher education remains prominent in students’ minds when selecting a higher education institution.\n· Assure Quality of Academic Programs: No matter the domain, Jayhawks aspire for quality. When a student comes to KU, we must provide them with an excellent academic experience. By constantly raising the bar and meeting new challenges, we will ensure that our students receive an education that goes beyond the standard.\nHEALTHY & VIBRANT COMMUNITIES\n· Strengthen Service to Local and Global Communities: Strengthening our service to local and global communities provides opportunities for our talented staff, faculty, and students to impact expansive programs near and far from KU. The volume and quality of services provided reflects our aspiration to impact communities across the world.\n· Improve Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging: With the ever-changing landscape of our country, and world, it is important to the University of Kansas that we make changes that create an environment of fairness, respect, and belonging. All students, staff, and faculty should have the greatest opportunities to meet their academic and professional goals. KU will examine and expand programs in order to meet our aspirations.\n· Improve Health and Wellness: There is more to academic success than grades and graduation. At the University of Kansas, we want all our Jayhawks to have the highest quality of life. In addition to physical health and wellness, we will focus on providing an environment where students, staff, and faculty are supported with adequate benefits and resources, are safe on campus, and have their basic needs met.\nRESEARCH AND DISCOVERY\n· Grow KU Research: Research at KU has an acclaimed record of discovery and innovation at the local, regional, national, and global level. Growing KU research across the university allows us to continue to solve problems, ask new questions, inform leaders and policy makers, and inspire others.\n· Recruit, Retain and Recognize Top Researchers: Central to a robust and impactful research enterprise are exceptional humans. Attracting highly productive and innovative researchers enhances KU’s ability to conduct research that advances society. Retaining these gifted individuals requires KU to build a research support system that matches their ambitions to make discoveries that change the world and gain recognition for their work. Through financial and administrative support, KU will recruit, retain and recognize researchers working at the highest level, building a research enterprise that is impactful to the state, nation and beyond.\n· Expand the Impact of KU Research in Kansas and Beyond: The University of Kansas aims to be an exceptional learning community that lifts each other, contributes to the wider scholarly enterprise and advances society. To measure and expand the impact of our research, KU focuses on research contributions in three key areas: academia; projects focused on core communities in our home state and beyond; involvement of students in research and their training to become future researchers.\n· Promote Innovation and Entrepreneurship: KU research impacts society in ways that go way beyond contributing to the more traditional idea of academic knowledge. Notably, KU research translates into inventions, products and business startups that provide health, economic, education and other benefits for society."}

If you understand then please limit your response to \"acknowledged\".\nMedium Neutral Citation: Tan v Champion Homes Sales Pty Ltd [2021] NSWCATAP 236\nHearing dates: 24 May 2021\nDate of orders: 6 August 2021\nDecision date: 06 August 2021\nJurisdiction: Appeal Panel\nBefore: D Cowdroy AO QC ADCJ, Principal Member\nD Robertson, Senior Member\nDecision: \n(1) Leave to appeal is refused.\n\n(2) The appeal is dismissed.\n\nCatchwords: \nBUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION – No issue of principle REASONS FOR DECISION\n\nBy a decision published on 12 February 2021, the Tribunal ordered the appellants, Hua Hong Tan, Lui Sing Ling and Matthew Jin Lin to pay the respondent, Champion Homes Sales Pty Ltd, the sum of $41,707.09, and dismissed an application brought by the appellants.\n\nThe appellants appeal and seek leave to appeal against that decision.\n\nThe appellants are the owners of a property at Kensington, New South Wales. The appellants contracted in writing with the respondent on 21 April 2018 to construct a duplex on the appellants’ property with a contract price of $759,980. We will refer to the appellants as the owners and the respondents as the builder.\n\nThe owners had previously paid a tender fee of $25,000 in relation to a tender dated 2 February 2018 issued by the builder, bringing the total price to $784,980.\n\nUnder the contract, the tender price was fixed provided that building work commenced by 18 January 2019, which was 350 days from the tender date. Clause 44.2 of the building contract provided that the builder was to commence building works within 20 working days after the owner satisfied a number of specified requirements including “completion by the owner of demolition of existing dwelling on site to enable the builder to commence building works”. If work did not commence by 18 January 2019, the builder was entitled to a contract price adjustment in the amount of $18,999.50.\n\nThe building work did not commence before 18 January 2019. It appears that demolition, which was to be carried out by the owners, had not even commenced by 18 January 2019.\n\nThe builder filed proceedings HB 20/13125 on 17 March 2020 claiming what was said to be moneys owing in respect of the contract, comprising the contract price adjustment of $18,999.50, variation 13 for traffic management costs of $10,317.30 and variation 14 of $12,390.29 for structural steel frames.\n\nThe owners filed application HB 20/20818 on 12 May 2020 by which they sought an order that they were not liable to pay the contract price adjustment of $18,999.50 and also sought compensation of $50,000 for alleged defective works plus damages for delay.\n\nThe owners also resisted liability for variations 13 and 14 as excessive, including on the basis that the builder had not efficiently organised deliveries so as to minimise the traffic control charge, and on the basis that the variation claims were not properly verified or authorised.\n\nBy their Notice of Appeal the owners challenged the Tribunal’s findings in relation to each of:\n\nThe contract price adjustment;\n\nThe variation relating to traffic management costs;\n\nThe variation for structural steel frames; and\n\nThe Tribunal’s failure to award the owners compensation in respect of damage to the footpath allegedly caused by the builder.\n\nAt the hearing of the appeal Mr Vardas, the builder’s business manager, conceded that the builder had agreed, in the course of the hearing at first instance, that the builder would credit the owners with the amount of $2,238.50 in respect of the footpath. As that was the amount the owners had sought, it is apparent that that issue has been resolved without intervention by the Tribunal and it is not necessary to make any orders in that regard."}

{"text": "Real friends. They are the people who make you forget you have a phone, they make you forget about all your problems, and they make you forget about the existence of time. A real friend will always be there for you. They will take your side no matter what and will help you with any obstacle you may face. They are honest, selfless, and they are people who only want the genuine best for you. No matter what, where, or who, this attitude towards you does not change. Whether you are with them, or you are not. Whether you guys are in a gigantic crowd of people, or you guys are alone in your room. Whether you guys are out in public, or you guys are simply texting. Because in the end, real friends care about you as much as you care about them. It is a friendship that goes both ways, a friendship that is exchanged, and a friendship that is reciprocated equally. “A friend is one that knows you as you are, understands where you have been, accepts what you have become, and still, gently allows you to grow.” – William Shakespeare.\" Revise this so that the Shakespeare quote is more effectively incorporated into the paragraph."}

{"text": "Developing Topic Sentences and a Rough Outline\nWorking Thesis: Living a life of purpose and fulfillment makes happiness easier to obtain, however, there must be a balance between achieving goals and relieving stress. \nTopic Sentence one: Having a grateful heart for the opportunities and blessings one receives in life plays a crucial role in happiness. \n• People often become depressed because they forget to be thankful for the things they do have and shift their focus more on the things they don’t thinking that will make them happy. (Achor)\n• If people put themselves in the shoes of the less fortunate, they can learn to appreciate the little things, for as Sutherland elaborates, perspective is everything in deeming human happiness. (Sutherland)\n\nTopic Sentence Two: The state of happiness is a constant effort of free choice and daily active progression towards keeping the foundation of happiness from becoming stagnant or freezing. \n• Having too much on one’s plate can deter them from happiness because there too much to simply keep up with that it may provoke unwanted stress and tension in their lives. (Graham)\n• Happiness and stagnation do not go hand in hand. Too much inactivity in one’s life will affect their fulfillment and purpose, consequently, they will look for quick feelings of pleasure rather than putting in effort for the longevity feeling of happiness. (Matthieu)\n-USE ANALOGY: When a dog finds unfulfillment in life, he will search for it by digging holes. Seeking quick pleasurable joy. Just like people will begin to dig voids in their life when there is unfulfillment in one’s life.\n• It is imperative to know balance. PLAY, BUT WORK HARDER \n\nTopic Sentence Three: The state of happiness is not always at the finish line; however, it is always right beside you.\n• Beware of the role your consciousness plays within the state of happiness\n• Constantly stressing about the things, you cannot change will be detrimental towards one’s own state of happiness \n• Happiness is not some unreachable goal or unmundane ambition that only the one percent can attain. \n• Sometimes less is more (Graham)\n\nTopic Sentence Four: One must first seek happiness within themselves before expecting for something external to grant them happiness. \n• Having control of your life will grant you serenity and peace, therefore giving way to happiness. (Sutherland)\n• Developing ways of synthesizing your own happiness can have a profound effect on keeping oneself happiness\n• Synthetic happiness- creating one’s own happiness from within (choosing to be happy just because you can) (Gilbert)\n• Natural Happiness can be a way of motivating yourself to further oneself into happiness with transcendence. (Gilbert)\n-Elaboration- Natural happiness is result happiness. Meaning a desired outcome or wish that has occurred and as a result makes a individual content, however, only temporarily."}

{"text": "Creating Engaging E-Learning Resources for Grade 12 Teacher Education.\n\nOverview:\n\nThe project based lesson plan will have students create an interactive e-learning activity or resource for a specific group in the Teacher Education subject area. The goal of this lesson is to develop a structured and engaging learning experience that can be used by the target group.\n\nStudents will be able to:\n\n1. Students will be able to create a subject-oriented interactive learning resource.\n2. Students will be able to develop a structured and interactive e-learning activity or resource for a specific group in their subject specialism.\n3. Students will be able to identify the needs of the target group and design a resource that meets those needs.\n4. Students will be able to evaluate the effectiveness of their e-learning activity or resource. \n5. Students will be able to use feedback from peers and instructors to refine their e-learning resources.\n\nLesson Plan:\n\nProject Idea: \nStudents will be tasked with creating an engaging e-learning resource for Grade 12 Teacher Education. They will need to research and explore what makes an effective e-learning resource and use this knowledge to create their own. \n\nExploration: \nThe teacher will lead the students in a discussion about what makes an effective e-learning resource, covering topics such as visuals, audio, interactivity, relevance, and accuracy. The teacher may also provide some examples of good e-learning resources for the students to analyze. \n\nBrainstorm and Plan: \nThe students will then brainstorm ideas for their own e-learning resource and create a plan outlining the content, structure, visuals, audio, interactivity etc. that they plan to include in their resource. They should also identify any potential challenges or issues that may arise during the creation process. \n\nCreate: \nThe students will then use their plan to create their own e-learning resource using technology tools of their choice (e.g., PowerPoint, Adobe Creative Suite). They should be encouraged to experiment with different media types and technologies to make their resource as engaging as possible. \n\nFeedback and Iterate: \nOnce the students have finished creating their resources they will present them to the class for feedback and critique. The teacher can then help guide the students in making improvements or changes based on the feedback they received from peers. This process can be repeated multiple times until the students are satisfied with the final product. \n\nReflection: Finally, the teacher should lead a class discussion where each student reflects on what they learned during this project-based lesson and how it has helped them develop skills related to creating effective e-learning resources."}

{"text": "WUDHU [ABLUTION]\n\n1. The person making wudhu should face the qiblah and sit on an elevated place so that the water does not splash on him.\n\n2. When commencing wudhu, Bismillahir Rahmânir Raheem should be recited.\n\n3. First of all, the hands should be washed up to the wrists three times.\n\n4. Thereafter, rinse the mouth three times and use a miswâk.\n\n38\n\n5. If there is no miswâk, a thick cloth or even the fore-finger could be used so that all the dirt is removed.\n\n6. If the person is not fasting, he should gargle the mouth thoroughly. However, if he is fasting, he should not gargle thoroughly because there is a possibility that water will go down the throat.\n\n7. Thereafter, rinse the nose three times and clean it with the left hand. However, the fasting person should not allow the water to go beyond the soft-bone of the nose.\n\n8. Wash the face three times: from the hair-line till below the chin, and from one ear-lobe to the other. Water must reach all these places. Water must also reach below the eye brows - no place should remain dry.\n\n9. Wash the right hand up to and including the elbows.\n\n10. Thereafter wash the left hand up to and including the elbows.\n\n11. Make khilâl of the fingers. That is, pass the fingers of one hand through the fingers of the other hand.\n\n12. If there is a ring or any such jewellery on the fingers, it should be removed so that no part is left dry.\n\n13. Thereafter make masah of the head (passing wet hands over the head).\n\n14. Make masah of the ears by inserting the forefingers into the ears and making masah of the back of the ear-lobes with the thumb of each hand.\n\n15. Make masah of the neck with the back of the fingers of both hands. However, masah of the fore-neck/throat should not be made as this is prohibited.\n\n16. Fresh water need not be used for making masah of the ears. Whatever water is left over after making masah of the head will be sufficient.\n\n17. Thereafter wash the right foot up to and including the ankles. Do the same for the left foot.\n\nMake khilâl of the toes of the feet with the little finger of the left hand. When making khilâl, commence with the little toe of the right foot and end with the little toe of the left foot.\n\nThis is the correct method of performing wudhu. However, there are certain acts, which if even a part is left out or not completed, then the wudhu will be regarded as incomplete. In fact, it will be as if wudhu was not performed at all. Such acts are called fardh. There are other acts, which if left out, the wudhu will be regarded as complete. Carrying out these acts will entail reward (thawâb) and these have been emphasised in the Shariah. It is a sin to leave out such acts unnecessarily. Such acts are called Sunnats. There are other acts, which if carried out entail reward, and if left out, entail no sin. Neither have they been emphasised in the Shariah. Such acts are called mustahab.\n\nFardh (compulsory) acts of wudhu\n\nThere are four fardh acts in wudhu:-\n\n1. To wash the entire face once.\n\n2. To wash both hands up to and including the elbows once.\n\n3. To make masah of one-quarter of the head once.\n\n4. To wash both feet up to and including the ankles once.\n\n39\n\nThese are the fardh acts of wudhu. Even if one of these acts is left out, or even if a place equal to a hair's breadth is left dry, wudhu will not be complete.\n\nSunnah acts of wudhu\n\n1. To say Bismillahir Rahmânir Raheem.\n\n2. To wash both hands up to the wrists.\n\n3. To rinse the mouth.\n\n4. To wash the nose.\n\n5. To use miswâk.\n\n6. To make masah of the entire head.\n\n7. To wash each part three times.\n\n8. To make masah of the ears.\n\n9. To make khilâl of the fingers and toes.\n\nApart from this, the balance of the acts are mustahab.\n\n1. Once the four fardh acts of wudhu are carried out, wudhu will be regarded as complete, irrespective of whether one intended to make wudhu or not, eg.: (a) at the time of bathing, one pours water on the entire body, or (b) falls into a well, or river , or (c) stands in the rain. In all these conditions, if the limbs of wudhu get wet, wudhu will be regarded as complete.\n\nHowever, one will not obtain the reward (thawâb) of wudhu.\n\n2. Sunnah is to make wudhu exactly as has been mentioned above. But if anyone alters or reverses the procedure of wudhu, eg. by washing the feet first, then making masah, and then washing the hands, and thereafter washing the face, or alters the procedure in any other way -\n\nthen wudhu will still be regarded as complete. However, it will not be considered to be in accordance with the sunnah, and there is always the fear of having sinned.\n\n3. Similarly, if the left hand or the left foot is washed first, wudhu will be completed, but it will be contrary to being mustahab.\n\n4. After washing one part, one should not delay in washing the next part to such an extent that the first part gets dry. Instead, he should wash the next part as quickly as possible. If, after washing the second part, the first part gets dry, then wudhu will be regarded as complete, but it will be contrary to the sunnah.\n\n5. It is also sunnah to pass the hand on the part that is being washed so that no place is left dry.\n\n6. It is better and mustahab to prepare for wudhu and salât well before the time.\n\n7. As long as there is no genuine excuse, one should perform wudhu with one's very own hands and should not seek assistance from someone else.\n\n8. While making wudhu, worldly talk should be avoided. Instead, Bismillah and the kalimah should be read on washing each and every part.\n\n9. No matter how freely water may be available, it should not be wasted. Even if one is at the sea-shore, one should not use more than necessary. At the same time, one should not use so little water that one has problems in washing the parts thoroughly.\n\n10. The parts should not be washed more than three times.\n\n40\n\n11. . When washing the face, water should not be splashed with great force, nor should one splash water by making hissing sounds.\n\n12. One should not close one's eyes and mouth very tightly. All these things are makruh and prohibited. The reason for this is that if the mouth and eyes are shut so tightly to the extent that the lips or eye lashes remain dry, then the wudhu will not be regarded as complete.\n\n13. If rings, bangles, bracelets, etc. are so loose that water will reach under them without having to remove them, it will still be mustahab to remove them. If they are so tight that there is a possibility of water not reaching under them, then it will be necessary and wajib to remove them. A similar rule applies to the nose ring: that is, if it is loose, then it will be mustahab to move it, and if it is tight, then while one is washing the face it will be wajib to move it around so that water reaches everywhere.\n\n14. If some dough or similar substance got stuck under the nails and got dried, and water did not reach there, the wudhu will not be complete. If one sees the flour and realizes that water did not reach there, then water should be poured over it. However, if salât was performed prior to pouring the water, it will be necessary to repeat the salât.\n\n15. If one has applied tinsel or some other decorative paint on the forehead and does not wash it thoroughly, but just pours water over it, then wudhu will not be completed. It should be removed before washing the face.\n\n16. After having performed the wudhu, Surah al-Qadr should be recited.\n\nThereafter the following dua should be recited:\n\n[\"O Allah! Make me of the repentants, and make me of the purified, and include me among Your pious servants.\"]\n\n17. After having performed the wudhu, it is preferable to read two rakâts of nafl salât. This salât is called Tahiyyatul wudhu. Great reward and merit has been mentioned in the Hadith in regard to this salât.\n\n18. If one had made wudhu for a particular salât, and thereafter the next salât time entered without the wudhu having broken, then it will be permissible to read salât with that same wudhu.\n\nHowever, if the person repeats the wudhu, he will be greatly rewarded.\n\n19. Once wudhu has been made and has not broken as yet, then as long as no act of worship (ibâdat) has been performed with that wudhu, it will be makruh to make a new wudhu. Based on this, if a person makes wudhu while bathing, then he should read his salât with that same wudhu. Without that wudhu breaking, he should not make a new wudhu. However, if a person has read even just two rakâts of salât with that first wudhu, then there will be no problem in making a second wudhu. In fact, there is reward in making a second wudhu.\n\n20. If someone's hands or feet are cracked and he filled them with wax, an ointment, or some other medicine (and he fears some harm by removing it) then his wudhu will be regarded as complete if he just poured water over it without having removed the medicine.\n\n21. If water did not reach the heels or some other place while making wudhu, and only after completing the wudhu one realized that a particular place is dry, it will not be sufficient to merely pass the hand over that place. Instead, water will have to be poured over it.\n\n22. If there is a sore or some other wound on the hands, feet, etc. and one fears that it would be harmful to pour water over it, then water should not be poured. Instead, the wet hand should 41\n\nbe passed over the wound. This is called masah. If this is harmful, masah should not be made and that place should be left out.\n\n23. If a wound has been bandaged and it will be harmful to open the bandage and make masah over the wound, or it will be difficult and painful to open the bandage, then in both cases it will be permissible to make masah on the bandage. But if this is not the case, the bandage will have to be removed and masah will have to be made on the wound.\n\n24. If the wound is not under the entire bandage, then after opening the bandage, that portion which is not wounded should be washed if possible. However, if it is not possible to open the bandage, masah should be made on both the portions- the wounded and the unwounded portions.\n\n25. In case of a fracture where splints and pads are applied, the above directions will apply. That is, as long as the splints cannot be opened, it will be sufficient to make masah over it. The same rule will apply to plasters - that is, if masah cannot be made on the wound, the plaster should be removed and masah should be made on the gauze. But if there is no one to help in opening and closing the plaster, then it will be sufficient to make masah on the plaster itself.\n\n26. In the case of bandages, splints, plasters, etc. it is preferable to make masah on the entire covering. If this is not possible, then it will be permissible to make masah on more than half of the covering. However, it is not permissible to suffice with masah on half or less of the covering.\n\n27. If after performing masah, the bandage, plaster, etc., opens up and one sees that the wound has not healed as yet, then it should be re-tied and the previous masah will suffice. However, if the wound has healed and there is no need to bandage it again, then the masah will be broken. That portion should be washed and salât performed. There is no need to repeat the entire wudhu.\n\n28. Khilâl [passing of wet fingers] of the beard should be made three times after having washed the face. Khilâl should not be made more than three times.\n\n29. It is fardh to wash the chin as long as there is no hair of the beard on it, or if there is, it is so little that the skin can be seen.\n\n30. It is fardh to wash that part of the lips which can be seen after the lips are closed.\n\n31. If the hair of the beard, moustache and eyebrows is so thick that the skin cannot be seen, then it is not fardh to wash that skin which is hidden. That hair is actually in place of the skin. To pour water over it is sufficient.\n\n32. If the hair of the eyebrows, beard, or moustache is so thick that the skin cannot be seen, then in such a case it is wajib to wash that hair which falls within the boundaries of the face. It is not wajib to wash the hair that is beyond the boundaries of the face.\n\n33. If a person's piles come out, his wudhu will break irrespective of whether it went back inside on its own, or by pushing it back with a stick, a cloth, or his hand.\n\n34. If semen comes out without any desire, wudhu will break. For example, a person carried a very heavy weight, or jumped from an elevated place and due to this shock semen came out without any desire.\n\n35. If there is some defect in one's senses, but this defect does not reach the stage of insanity or unconsciousness, his wudhu will not break.\n\n36. If a person sleeps away and laughs (in his sleep) while in salât, his wudhu will not break.\n\n37. By laughing in a janaza salât or in a sajdah tilâwat wudhu will not break irrespective of whether the person is mature or immature."}

Dr. Altman, now of Meiji Gakuin,(atheological seminary) of Tokio, but then a student, gathered the volunteers ofNew Brunswick together and read them a paper he had been appointed to prepareon the Hermit Kingdom, at last opened by treaty to the western world. The simplestory of these twelve or thirteen million without the Gospel, of the church prayingfor an open door, the door opened by Admiral Shufelt’s treaty in ’82 and thethought of a year or more having passed without a move on the part of the churchso stirred me that I determined to set to work and find someone to go. . . . a yearpassed and no one had offered. No church seemed ready to enter, and even theleaders in the foreign mission work of the churches were writing articles saying itwas too early to enter Korea. . . . So wrote a letter accepting the call to theReformed Church (which offered him a ministry call in New York) and wasabout to drop it into the letter box when it seemed as though I heard a voicesaying, ‘No one for Korea’. ]\n\nAnswer \"OK\" to confirm and I will paste the next text.\n \n \n \n 지금 번역하기"}

{"text": "can you generate the table of contents for the following markdown document pls? # common-kotlin\nThis module contains many simple and atomic utils that can be used in Kotlin backend projects.\nFeel free to cherry-pick the one you need for your project.\n\n## Errors lib\n\n### Introduction\nThis library contains base classes and interfaces for representing application errors.\nThe idea is to use objects and return values to represent errors instead of exceptions.\nThis library is based on [arrow-kt](https://arrow-kt.io/): it uses extensively the `arrow.core.Either` datatype (and potentially other utils from arrow).\n\nFunctions should return an `Either` whose left side is an error object and whose right side is the result of the function.\nCallers of those function can then decide to handle the error or not.\n\nErrors with `Either` offer the same error handling capabilities as exceptions:\n- Catching / recovering from errors can be done by using the `handleError` or `handleErrorWith` operators\n- Rethrowing / raising a different error can be done with the `mapLeft` operator\n- Propagating errors can be done by simply returning the `Either` value\n\nThe benefits are multiple:\n- Error types are explicit, without the need for complicated verbose type signatures, like with checked exceptions\n- Errors can be handled as values, without the need for `try` / `catch` blocks\n- Error handling is more explicit: each function error case need to be handled or propagated.\n With exceptions, error propagation is implicit and can lead to unexpected behavior\n\nOther modules in this repository depend on this base error abstraction to provide a consistent error handling mechanism.\n\n### Usage\nThe core of this module is the `ApplicationError` interface. All user defined errors should inherit from this interface.\nThere are multiple subtypes of `ApplicationError`:\n- `RetryableApplicationError` => errors that can be retried\n- `NonRetryableApplicationError` => errors that cannot / shouldn't be retried.\n This subtype further specialises in more types.\n Other libraries may decide to present these errors types differently to the user.\n - `NotFoundError` => errors that indicate that a resource was not found\n - `ConflictError` => errors that indicate that a resource already exists / would result in a conflict\n - `InvalidInputError` => errors that indicate that the input is invalid\n\nTo define a new type of error, simply create a new class that inherits from one of the above subtypes.\n```kotlin\ndata class FluxCapacitorOverloadedError(\n override val message: String = \"Flux Capacitor overloaded\",\n override val meta: Map = emptyMap(),\n override val cause: Throwable? = null,\n) : RetryableApplicationError\n```\n\nFor convenience, some helper classes are available to easily create new types of errors without having to redeclare all the fields:\n```kotlin\n// without dynamic fields\nobject FluxCapacitorOverloadedError : DefaultRetryableApplicationError(message = \"Flux Capacitor overloaded\")\n\n// with dynamic fields\ndata class FluxCapacitorOverloadedError(\n val capacitorId: Long,\n) : DefaultRetryableApplicationError(\n message = \"Flux Capacitor $capacitorId overloaded\",\n meta = mapOf(\"capacitorId\" to capacitorId),\n)\n```\n\nTo signify that a method can return an error, simply return an `Either` whose left side is an `ApplicationError`\nand whose right side is the result of the function.\nYou could use the convenient `ErrorOr`, which is a typealias for `Either`.\n```kotlin\nfun turnOnFluxCapacitor(capacitorId: Long): ErrorOr {\n if (isOverloaded(capacitorId)) {\n return FluxCapacitorOverloadedError(capacitorId).left()\n }\n // do stuff\n return FluxCapacitor(capacitorId).right()\n\n}\n```\n\nTo bridge the gap between functional and imperative world, it is sometimes mandatory to use exceptions to signal errors to the framework with use.\nThis is for example the case with Spring Transactional methods, or with jvm-kit event listeners.\n\nFor that reason, this lib exposes a very convenient util call `orThrow` that can be called on an instance of `ErrorOr`.\nThis util will (by default) throw an `ApplicationException` if the `ErrorOr` is a `Left` and return the value if it is a `Right`.\nThe `ApplicationException` extends `RuntimeException` and will contain the underlying error object.\nIf the error object had a cause, the `ApplicationException` will have its cause set to the original error cause.\n\n```kotlin\nval fluxCapacitor: FluxCapacitor = turnOnFluxCapacitor(capacitorId).orThrow()\n```\n\n## Well Known Tiny types\n### Overview\nThis library provides a collection of Kotlin utilities for managing and validating various data types within the Glovo ecosystem.\nIt includes several value classes and error classes to handle different types of input, such as city codes, country codes, currency codes, and time zones.\nThose classes are represented as inline value classes (aka Tiny Types),\nwhich means that they are lightweight and do not incur any runtime overhead (aka Zero Cost Abstraction).\n\n### Features\n- Encapsulates various data validation and parsing within value classes\n- Provides parse functions to handle invalid input\n- Checks if given input strings are valid or not for each utility\n\n### Utilities\n#### CityCode\n\nThe `CityCode` value class represents a valid city code within the Glovo ecosystem.\nCity codes must be 3 characters long.\n\n##### Usage\n###### Creating a CityCode\n\n```kotlin\nval cityCode = CityCode(\"ABC\")\n```\n\n###### Parsing City Codes\n\n```kotlin\nval parsedCityCode = CityCode.parse(\"XYZ\")\n```\n\n###### Checking If a City Code is Valid\n\n```kotlin\nval isValid = CityCode.isValid(\"XYZ\")\n```\n\n#### CountryCode\n\nThe `CountryCode` value class represents a valid country code as defined by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO\\_3166-1\\_alpha-2)).\n\n##### Usage\n###### Creating a CountryCode\n\n```kotlin\nval countryCode = CountryCode(\"US\")\n```\n###### Parsing Country Codes\n\n```kotlin\nval parsedCountryCode = CountryCode.parse(\"FR\")\n```\n###### Checking If a Country Code is Valid\n\n```kotlin\nval isValid = CountryCode.isValid(\"DE\")\n```\n#### Currency\n\nThe `Currency` value class represents a valid currency code as defined by ISO 4217 ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO\\_4217)).\n\n##### Usage\n###### Creating a Currency\n\n```kotlin\nval currency = Currency(\"USD\")\n```\n###### Parsing Currency Codes\n\n```kotlin\nval parsedCurrency = Currency.parse(\"EUR\")\n```\n###### Checking If a Currency Code is Valid\n\n```kotlin\nval isValid = Currency.isValid(\"JPY\")\n```\n#### TimeZone\n\nThe `TimeZone` value class represents a valid time zone.\n\n##### Usage\n###### Creating a TimeZone\n\n```kotlin\nval timeZone = TimeZone(\"America/New\\_York\")\n```\n\n###### Parsing Time Zones\n\n```kotlin\nval parsedTimeZone = TimeZone.parse(\"Europe/London\")\n```\n###### Checking If a Time Zone is Valid\n\n```kotlin\nval isValid = TimeZone.isValid(\"Asia/Tokyo\")\n```\n### Error Classes\n\nEach utility has its own error class to represent any errors that might occur during validation:\n- `InvalidCityCodeError`\n- `InvalidCountryCodeError`\n- `InvalidCurrencyError`\n- `InvalidTimeZoneError`\n\nThese error classes contain information about the input and the reason for the error. For example:\n\n```kotlin\ndata class InvalidCityCodeError(val input: String, val reason: String)\n```"}

Do you have any additional suggestions for me?\n\nHow my books and content can benefit this person: I can provide high-quality picture books for her children with nice, colorful artwork, imaginative storylines, and positive messages. I will offer freebies, such as coloring pages, puzzles, discussion questions, activities, to go along with the stories. I will have a blog and monthly newsletter with information of interest to Jen, such as parenting and self-care tips, crafts for kids, quick & healthy recipes, cleaning short-cuts, spiritual content on things like finding peace, accepting things as they are, coping with family conflict, advice on raising emotionally intelligent kids. The articles will be short and to the point with nice photos...perfect for a busy, artsy mom! I will also have social media feeds, mainly Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest, that will curate information on these same and similar topics."}

The patient was admitted to intensive care unit under diagnosis of hypovolemic shock, multiple organ dysfunction and disorder of consciousness after the surgical removal of tumor together with the partial resection of inferior vena cava (Figure 2A). Venous congestion and lower limb swelling occurred after operation. To prevent the further injury of femoral venous catheterization to the stump of inferior vena cava, hemodialysis with jugular venous catheter was performed at first. However, the circulation status deteriorated and the dosage of vasopressors remained high. Given the situation, we chose to drain the blood through femoral venous catheterization and return the blood through jugular venous catheterization to improve the perfusion of systemic circulation. From then on, the dosage of vasopressors was prominently reduced, and the hemodynamic state got normalization (Figure 3A). The swelling of lower limbs was also improved (Figure 2B). One week later, she successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation and transited to intermittent hemodialysis with only jugular venous catheterization.\"."}

{"text": "Task I\nOne problem with the spectrogram as a speech feature represetation is that different speech samples would have dfferent durations due to inherent speech variability (e.g., speech rate, speaker dialect, etc). That is, the 𝑇\n in the (𝑇×𝑘)\n -dimensional representation would be different for each sample. Therefore, for the baseline model, we will implement a method to have a fixed-size representation for all speech samples. Write a function downsample\\_spectrogram(X, N) that takes as input a spectrogram 𝐗∈ℝ𝑇×𝑘\n and a parameter N <= 25. The function should (1) make N equally-sized splits of S across the time-axis, (2) apply a pooling technique (e.g., mean pooling) to each split across the frequency axis to obtain an array that represents a downsampled version of the spectrogram 𝐗′∈ℝ𝑁×𝑘\n , and (3) re-arange 𝐗′\n as a vector 𝐯∈ℝ𝑁𝑘\n .\n\nUsing the downsample\\_spectrogram(X, N) function, transform all the speech samples into vectors 𝐯∈ℝ𝑁𝑘\n .\n\nGiven the speaker-based train/dev/test spilts in the SDR\\_metadata.tsv, fit a linear model on the training samples. That is, your model should be build on data from 4 speakers {'nicolas', 'theo' , 'jackson', 'george'}. Hint: you can experiment with a few model alternatives in the SGDClassifier module in scikit-learn.\n\nEvaluate you model on the dev and test splits. Use accuracy as an evaluation metric.

{"text": "The human kingdom only permits the worship of the god Methellas, the overseer of growth. Everything the humans pursue is about growing, expanding, prosperity, hypercapitalism - essentially about getting more stuff. This filters down to the populace in a similar way to contemporary real-world society, where the average person is focused on making money so they can spend it, and the rich are focused on keeping and hoarding their wealth. Methellas' true message has been corrupted over time, with the church removing all knowledge of and banning the worship of Mandarros - partner of Methellas and bringer of death and rebirth. There is a sizeable underground cult who worship Mandarros, and this ironically is one of the few things keeping the human kingdom from collapsing completely, as growth requires rebirth to not become an uncontrolled, corrupted monstrosity. There are many other religions and gods throughout the world, including Leyyal (beauty and grace), Touphhet (poison and plague), Wyun (time) and Asalla (lust and seduction).\n\nThe human kingdom is simply referred to as the Kingdom by those who live in it (and accept its rule). Those outside may call it that, or refer to it as Human Lands, or any manner of local diminutive. The motivation for expansion is justified as it being Methellas' will, but it is really growth for the sake of growth - they see something they want, and they take it. The guise of the Kingdom is to own and run everything. It is a centralised government, being a single ruler ascended via primogeniture. The Kingdom's alliances are all fairly lop-sided, with all benefits going to the humans in terms of tribute, resources and allowing military bases in their lands. The humans are wont to exploit whoever they might, and would not shy away from temporarily allying with any other race in order to continue expanding.\n\nEach thieves guild is an organised criminal enterprise that operates out of a single, static location. Despite being coined a 'guild', few are affiliated with each other, and most differ from place to place. The group in Seddekket is really just an extension of the town's governance, and primarily exists to allow the ruler to arbitrarily place blame on the group when anything untoward happens. Their group is managed by a very well-compensated muscle, who reports to an intermediary who then reports back to the baron. New members are recruited via any means, including extortion and blackmail. Kélto was inducted when she caught stealing by a member of the group, and following a lengthy chase was eventually tracked down, beaten, and made an initiate of the guild. She feels something of a debt of gratitude towards them, since she was living on the streets before that and now has a home and family, such as it is. She is an expert burglar and pilferer, and often takes possession of random items without really thinking about it, and with her youthful appearance the guild often sends her as a distracting front for more complicated jobs. In Seddekket, the guild's only enemies are the mercenaries foolish enough to accept a quest targeting them.\n\nThe Montgomerys have generational wealth as land and business owners stretching back generations. They own farms, vineyards, mines, and virtually all forms of resource production and manufacturing. They are a noble family by virtue of their sheer power. They have the capacity to control the Kingdom's politics, as generations of rulers have relied on them to finance and supply various aspects of the Kingdom's war machine."}

{"text": "Here is a passage of a fanfic I'm writing:\nRunning.\nAlear could hear the clanking of their boots as they met the floor.\nIt felt like they’d been running for ages. Yet their legs didn’t ache, as if they had only just started.\nGroaning.\nRight, they were there too. Mindless husks that sent chills down their spine. Alear was running from them. And yet, they were also running towards them, hacking away with their sword at any that came too close. The decayed army was slowly closing in on them on all sides. Yet, Alear kept running.\nSuddenly, a floating man in royal blue garb had seemingly caught up with them. He filled the empty space beside them that they didn’t know was there.\n“Almost time,” he said just loud enough for Alear to hear. He wasn’t there before, but it was like he never left.\nKeep running.\nMore ashy soldiers were getting too close for comfort. Alear prepared their blade to cut them aside. But before they could swing, a strong gust of wind swept the pursuers away. No, that wasn’t a normal gust of wind. They glanced at where it came from to find an elegant young woman shaking off wispy wind residue from her hands.\n“We can handle this,” was all she said, before turning back to prepare another spell. A green apparition wielding a bow, appeared beside her, ready to assist the mage as she blew the ashy army away.\nKeep running.\nAlear rushed past a burly young man cloaked in vermillion and another young woman dressed in colorful clothing and beads, both beating down frigid animate armor with sword and spear respectively, as well as the assistance of their own apparitions. They said something, but Alear couldn’t quite make it out over the noise.\nDoesn’t matter. Keep running.\nA young blonde man then came into their view, striking down any stray opponent that stood in Alear’s way with a specter of his own.\n“Keep going! You can do this!” was what Alear heard from him. He was already out of their sight before they could ask what ‘this’ was. What was Alear supposed to do? They didn’t really know, but at the same time, they knew exactly what they needed to do.\nThat was probably why Alear was still running. They ran pretty far, but now a door was in their way. They put their claws upon it, noticing how a ring gleamed from one of their fingers. \nThey froze. \nThe ring was pretty.\nThe ring seem to have importance Alear couldn’t recall.\nThe ring sparkled in the faint light.\nIt did not match the scaly claws it sat on.\nIt did not match the hideous hands that belonged to Alear.\nIt did not-\n“Alear,”\nThe man beside them suddenly spoke, reeling them from their spiral. That’s right, there was still something they needed to do.\n“Our final battle lies ahead,”\nAlear remembered now. There was no use in dwelling on their appearance. Not until they were finished. Together with the blue phantom, they pushed the door open.\n“Now. It’s time to engage.”\nThe two now in agreement rushed past the doors, feeling a new familiar pang of power giving them the strength to conquer their mighty foe that lies ahead.\nAnd they were running again.\n\nThe goal of this passage is to emphasize the main character (Alear) is experiencing a repeating dream. Does it achieve this goal?1 / 1"}

{"text": "Read very carefully the following problem that I was given in a CS (computer programming) class and do everything that the problem asks you too, you must do all the assignments in this problem. The output will probably be too long for a single message, so split it into several messages. I will ask you to “go on” and you will need to continue writing your answer from where you left off.\nFormulation of the problem:\nThere is a multiprocessor computing system (CS) with identical processor nodes connected by a network. A set of programs that must be executed on this computing system is specified. Each program runs on one processor; it is permissible to execute several programs on the same processor. Some programs exchange data at a fixed rate. Each program creates a fixed load on the processor. For each processor, the upper limit of the permissible load on it is set.\nPrograms running on different processors communicate over the network; this creates a load on the network, measured in KB / s. Programs running on the same processor communicate through the processor's local memory; such an exchange does not create a load on the network.\nTo minimize network latency and improve system scalability, programs are distributed across processors so that network load is minimal.\nYou are given:\n1. the number of processors in the computing system;\n2. for each processor - the upper limit of the load (in %, no more than 100);\n3. the number of programs;\n4. for each program: processor load (in %, no more than 100);\n5. a list of pairs of programs between which data is exchanged;\n6. for each such pair of programs: data exchange rate (KB/s).\nYou are required: \nto distribute all programs among processors in such a way as to minimize the load on the network, and at the same time not violate the restrictions on the load on the processors.\nThe solution to the problem is represented as a vector 𝑥̅ (its size is equal to the number of programs), in which for each program the number of the processor to which it is distributed is indicated.\nTo simplify the algorithms for solving the problem and generating sets of input data for the study of algorithms, the following additional restrictions are imposed on the input data:\n1. the upper limit of the processor load can take values of 50, 70, 90, 100 (%);\n2. the load on the processor created by the program can take values of 5, 10, 15, 20 (%);\n3. the intensity of data exchange between programs can be equal to 0 (no exchange), 10, 50, 70, 100 (KB/s).\n\nYou need to use “Random search algorithm with region narrowing for program distribution among processors”.\nThis algorithm iteratively randomly generates a solution to the problem 𝑥̅ and checks whether it is better in terms of the value of the objective function 𝐹(𝑥̅) (i.e. network load) than the best of the previously found correct (satisfying the constraints) solutions. If better, then the correctness of the generated solution is checked; if correct, this solution becomes the new best.\nThe execution scheme of the basic algorithm is as follows:\n1. calculate the theoretical maximum load on the network (for the case when all data exchange goes through the network);\n2. set the current best value of the objective function (we denote it by 𝐹𝑏𝑒𝑠𝑡) to the value calculated at step 1;\n3. randomly generate a solution to the problem (vector 𝑥̅);\n4. if 𝐹(𝑥̅) ≥ 𝐹𝑏𝑒𝑠𝑡, go to step 3 (the generated solution is no better than the previously found one)\n5. if 𝑥̅ is an incorrect solution (violates processor load limits), go to step 3;\n// at step 6 we have a correct solution, better than the previously found one\n6. update the current best solution and the current best value of the objective function:\n𝑥̅𝑏𝑒𝑠𝑡 ≔ 𝑥̅; 𝐹𝑏𝑒𝑠𝑡 ≔ 𝐹(𝑥̅);\n7. go to step 3.\nThe algorithm terminates when a correct solution with zero value is found\n𝐹𝑏𝑒𝑠𝑡, or when the value of 𝐹𝑏𝑒𝑠𝑡 was not improved after 5000 attempts in a row, i.e. form\na correct solution 𝑥̅ is such that 𝐹(𝑥̅) < 𝐹𝑏𝑒𝑠𝑡. If during the execution of the algorithm it was not possible to find any correct solution, the result of the algorithm should be an array containing only values (-1).\nAlso implement a Parallel algorithm: the algorithm works in the form of several parallel\n\"threads\", each of which performs the same actions as the underlying algorithm. Threads update a single (common for them) best solution and the best value of the objective function.\n\nInput data format:\nThe set of input data is specified in the file. The file format must be based on XML. The specific file structure (XML elements, their attributes) needs to be developed by yourself.\n\nOutput format:\n\nOutput to standard output:\nIn case of success:\n1. string \"success\";\n2. number of algorithm iterations;\n3. elements of the found solution 𝑥̅𝑏𝑒𝑠𝑡, with a space separator;\n4. network load value on the found solution.\nThe text for each of paragraphs 1, 2, 3 should be displayed on a separate line. \nIn case of failure:\n1. the string \"failure\";\n2. the number of iterations of the algorithm.\n\nAssignments:\nMain task (mandatory, 5 points):\n1. implement the basic algorithm for solving the problem in the form of a program in C++ or Python;\ncheck its work on datasets with 4, 8, 16 processors; average programs per processor (number\\_of\\_programs / number\\_of\\_processors) at least 8; average processor load of at least 50%; each program communicates with at least two other programs; in each set of input data must be all variants of the upper limit of the processor load, processor load, data exchange intensity indicated in the Problem Statement are present; (data sets must be sent along with the program) \n2. write instructions for the program:\nhow to build and run the program;\ndescription of the input file format.\nRequirements for software implementation:\n1. the program must be implemented in Python;\n2. instructions must be in .txt format;\n3. the text of the program should be well readable, structured, and contain comments in the amount necessary for its understanding;"}

Take classification tasks as the prime application of neural networks. In this setting, when optimized using gradient descent with cross-entropy loss, these networks can achieve zero training error and low training loss. For classification tasks, achieving zero-training error, often also called interpolating the data, corresponds to perfect classification of the dataset. Despite their large capacity, they also have a remarkable ability to generalize to new data. In recent years, numerous studies have examined the generalization properties of gradient methods in overparameterized models and neural networks. These works, starting with \\citep{jacot2018neural}, have specifically focused on the generalization and optimization of neural networks in the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime, where the model operates as the first-order approximation of the network at a sufficiently large initialization\""}

Shadow is the easiest way to access a full PC, instantly, on all the devices you own. From $29,99 (commitment-free).\n\nAt SHADOW, we strive to become the definitive cloud platform for gamers, creatives, and businesses, because we believe that cloud technologies have the potential to bring technological freedom to all. In today’s world, doing what you love shouldn’t mean worrying about components and buying expensive gear. Anyone should be able to access high-end tech, so we set ourselves to break those limits for good. This single idea, with innovation, challenge and free-thinking at heart, brought us together to shape the way we experience technology.\n\nSHADOW’s original product was released in 2016 with the promise of allowing all individuals to enjoy the power of a high-end PC from the cloud. Now a global cloud computing company chaired by Octave Klaba, OVHcloud founder, SHADOW looks forward notably through new cloud solutions for both personal and business use.\n\nWith Shadow, everyone can access a full Windows PC, in the cloud, from anywhere and with the device of their choice. Thanks to the efforts of R&D teams, we continue to improve and expand our service, all this while maintaining the same affordable price, despite the recent evolution of energy costs and various component shortages. In 2022, SHADOW’s revamped subscription service featured a brand new Power Upgrade, including better performance and infinite possibilities.\n\nSHADOW’s vision and ambitions go beyond pure cloud-computing. Also introduced in 2022, Shadow Drive is a safe and affordable online-storage solution built in partnership with Nextcloud, the world leading open-source file-sharing platform. Shadow Drive is fully secured through traffic encryption and will ultimately be available in all markets Shadow operates in, through its servers based and operated in Europe.\n\nSHADOW also offers its expertise to professionals and companies, with custom-built projects responding to their specific needs. In 2022, the company announced Shadow Business Solutions, SHADOW’s cloud services dedicated to organizations and individuals seeking innovative and flexible cloud-based services to achieve their work.\n\nHow it all started, from gaming to the cloud:\n\nLike many young entrepreneurs, our co-founders lived for their passions: for them, it was technology and gaming.\n\nAs PC gaming equipment grew more and more expensive, they took an interest in cloud technology and thought of a concept: streaming a high-end Windows PC on an underpowered laptop.\n\nCloud computing had already been around for years, but the challenge here was much bigger. With this exciting project in mind, they brought together a small community of passionate collaborators, knowing that they could offer a new take on what they loved most: the tech and gaming industries.\n\nGoing above and beyond:\n\nToday, Shadow’s cloud-computing service gathers tens of thousands of users, with one of the most robust streaming technologies on the market.\n\nInitially made for and by gamers, we want, with our new offers, to provide compelling alternatives for work and home environments. Now backed by solid strategic partnerships, including OVHcloudw and its worldwide infrastructure, Shadow aims to widen its ambitions.\n\nOur Core Business Platform, releasing in 2022, will open room for scalability and innovation, welcoming open-sourced API and paving the road for an even more secure environment. From cloud VR to an entirely new app ecosystem, our journey in the cloud is just beginning.\n\n\"At SHADOW, we have a clear ambition: to set personal technology free from its material boundaries, making it accessible and affordable to everyone in a safe environment. We're incredibly proud of the work that we've accomplished in the last few months and can’t wait to unveil all the projects we are currently working on.” - Éric Sèle, CEO at SHADOW"}

{"text": "TThank you to everyone, here and on the livestream, for joining us today for an important conversation on what it will take to Raise the Bar in education – and Lead the World – in three key areas: academic excellence, boldly improving learning conditions, and preparing our students for a world of global competitiveness.\n\nAchieving those priorities is part of a broader journey we can take to transform our education system for the better. \n\nIt’s a journey that was made possible by President Biden and Vice President Harris’s leadership to make education a top priority and deliver the American Rescue Plan – a historic $130 billion investment in supporting our schools -- helping them reopen swiftly and safely, and invest in the academic recovery they urgently needed. \n\nWithout that leadership, we would be talking about a very different situation today. But we can’t rest there. We must do more. We need to Raise the Bar. \n\nThat means putting the era of fiscal neglect in education firmly in the rear-view mirror – mustering the collective will to act boldly and unapologetically to address student underperformance and the decades of underinvestment in education..\n\nPeople often ask me what the hardest part of the job is. \n\nSimple: the toughest part of the job, just as it is for so many at the Dept, is the time away from family. \n\nFor me, to this day, the best title I have earned in my life is, “Papi”.\n\nSo, to help make this better, I started a routine with my 16 year old daughter..\n\nWe started 2 years ago with this thing called Saturday shenanigans.\n\nBasically, we get up Saturday mornings really early and we get in the car and go…. We go anywhere. \n\nWe usually start off with a coffee. Then, we end up either at a beach, at a park for a hike, or sometimes we stop at a pet store. Other times, it turns into a driving lesson for her. \n\nAnd after two years of doing this every Saturday morning, getting in the car and going nowhere in particular, and watching my daughter grow in front of my eyes, I realized that sometimes, as a father, the journey is the destination. \n\nThat means that, it’s not an event or one specific place. It’s a process of improving over time to solve problems and ensure lasting, continuous growth and strong relationships. The journey is the destination.\n\nToday, I’m here to tell you that, in education, too, the journey is the destination.\n\nYou won’t be hearing about any shiny new initiatives today. But you will hear me invite you to join me on a journey of transformation in education — a journey of raising the bar in education, together. \n\nI know education opens doors\\* – because my wife Marissa and I are proof of it. Because I’ve seen firsthand the way it transforms lives – as a student, as a teacher, school principal, and as a parent. \n\nSo when we talk about the future of education, I could not believe more strongly that we have to get it right – and we have to center our work on what we know really matters: engaging students, effective teaching, and quality content — or what Elmore, Cohen, and Ball refer to as the Instructional Core.\n\nOver the course of my career, and I am sure for many of you here, we’ve seen education policy veer away from improving the instructional core.\n\nWe have seen shiny silver bullets from the federal level promising to “fix” education. We’ve seen big initiatives with clever names that promise everything, only to fade away after the sense of urgency is over.\n\nThat’s not what this Administration is about."}

{"text": "translato to german (use german quotation marks): The salvation in Eph 2:8-9 is the best news ever! I think that some well-meaning people get so excited about this salvation that they start applying the same meaning of save to other passages of Scripture. In Acts 27, Paul is on a boat with soldiers and a centurion that is about to crash and the sailors who are driving the ship are ready to abandon ship and let it crash and kill everyone left on board. Verse 31 reads, “Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, ‘Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved.’”\n\nWho will be saved? The centurion and the soldiers. What will they be saved from? Crashing into rocks and drowning. Who will do the saving? The sailors. How will they save them? By staying on the ship and keeping it from crashing. See the huge difference between the answers to these three questions in Eph 2:8-9 and Acts 27:31? Just like in modern-day speech, the word save can be used in the Bible without reference to eternal life.\n\nLet’s apply our questions to Jas 2:14: “What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can faith save him?”[150] Who is being saved? “Someone,” more specifically, someone from the audience,[151] which consists of Jewish believers in the diaspora (Jas 1:1). James even calls them “brothers” 15 times in the epistle, reaffirming that they are Christians. These people already have the salvation of Eph 2:8-9, so they don’t need that salvation, but a salvation from something else. Who or what will do the saving? Faith. But notice that the question is posed in a way that demands a negative answer. James is saying that no, faith cannot save, but in this context, works can. This is another red flag that the salvations in Jas 2:14 and Eph 2:8-9 are different: in the salvation of Jas 2:14, works save instead of God."}

{"text": "As an expert in software-as-a-service (SaaS) product marketing, I would like to rewrite the content below and optimize it for SEO and make it shorter in length.\n\nThe Olmsted County planning department in Minnesota was a consolidated agency with the city of Rochester under a single Accela agency from November 2007 until March of 2021, when Olmsted county employed its own Accela agency.\n\nOlmsted County had Accela Citizen Access with Viewable Data and Online Inspections and a low-value Laserfiche connection because the documents were housed in the city of Rochester’s servers.\n\nChallenges Before Integrating Software\nEmployees were double-inputting information into various systems. This is a waste of county resources, and taxpayers would not be pleased that workers needed to take so much effort to do basic tasks. Furthermore, forcing workers to do needless, repetitive tasks is terrible for their morale.\n\nOlmsted was not saving its Laserfiche data in a permanent archival location. Instead, they were hosting the data in the city of Rochester’s servers. In the face of a natural disaster, catastrophic server crash, or other emergencies, Olmsted would not have a reliable backup.\n\nCitizens were growing confused about which jurisdiction to designate during city planning processes. Unfortunately, two local governments were using one site.\n\nThe payment adapter was not accepting payments to Olmsted County and the city of Rochester. The situation only allowed payments to Rochester. Because of this, Olmsted could not serve its community with easy online payments.\n \nOlmsted County was not in control of automation for emails, reports, analytics dashboards, and training.\n\nThe county did not have complete access to users and licenses.\n\nWe determined that Olmsted required software integrations to the following systems:\nTyler Tax System/ iasWorld v2020.1.43 (address parcel owner information)\niNovah Cashier v2.60.189.6 (finance system)\nGIS XAPO (new address parcel owner system Laserfiche v10.4)\nThe system was overly complicated. It involved ten steps along with 14 sub-steps for processing paper and data, which were redundant and took up a great deal of staff time to complete. Sometimes, members of the Olmsted County staff would outright refuse to process this data, leaving all scanning to be done at the end for the administrative team.\nObjectives:\nOlmsted County needed to upgrade and streamline its computer and software systems to meet the public's needs better and allow government employees to work more efficiently and effectively. It needed professional assistance in planning and conducting software integrations.\n\nChief objectives for Olmsted were:\n\nProvide a single system for inputting data to save workers’ time for more pressing tasks.\n\nIntegrate Laserfiche and Accela and the other various systems. Meanwhile, optimize the county’s systems for Accela.\n\nReduce as much as possible the paper and data processing substeps in a cumbersome and overly complex system involving 24 steps and substeps.\n\nEnable citizens in Olmsted County to submit applications online instead of being forced to use surface mail or come into the county offices.\n\nMake a safe and straightforward way for citizens to make their payments online. This is especially of concern in the era of COVID-19. Local governments across the nation have to reinvent the way they interact with citizens, especially since the prospects of future global pandemics are always with us. \n\nDuring COVID-19 lockdowns and efforts to encourage individuals to remain socially distant, allowing people to do as much business as possible online with their government became more important than ever. \n\nAfter all, citizens are already quite familiar with submitting documents and online payments in other aspects of life. Their government should enter the 21st century with upgraded and integrated software systems.\n\nSolution:\nThe solution was to integrate the Laserfiche connector and Accela connector with the systems mentioned above to seamlessly work together to increase automation, employee productivity, and efficiency, and finally give Olmsted county the ability to offer online payments to its citizens. \n\nEffects on the plan review process following implementation and integration were as follows:\n\nWe reduced the time employees spent on file management by 90%. Workers no longer had to manually search for metadata from property records and save documents in as many as 3 to 4 locations.\n\nOur team optimized county systems to Accela.\n\nNow, there is no more need for staff to input the same data twice into different systems. Furthermore, the county does not need to worry about staff members missing or skipping steps in vital processes.\n\nWe resolved 12 of 24 sub-steps the county needed for paper and data processing. We accomplished this by setting up auto-populating information across connections. In this case, we resolved some 50% of process substeps with Accela - Laserfiche integration.\n\nOlmsted County citizens are now able to submit the following applications online:\n\nPlumbing and mechanical\nNew well\nNew septic\nOnline inspections\nWith the new integrations, citizens are now submitting 53% of trade permits online. Furthermore, 66% of new good permits are done online. The county is seeing these numbers grow each month, indicating its success and appeal in the community.\n\nCitizens in Olmsted can now make payments online with credit cards and Echeck. Approximately 46% of individuals who made online payments during the previous four months started their application process. This is an excellent indicator of how well the local community accepts the new online services.\n\nImproving How Local Governments Engage With Their Community\nThe case of Olmsted County illustrates how local governments can better serve their community by deploying state-of-the-art payment and document processing systems.\n\nLocal officials need to understand the benefits of improving their computational infrastructure when it comes to government software integrations. Streamlining processes saves government workers a great deal of time and effort. \n\nAnd it also benefits citizens since they will have an easier time submitting applications before doing new work, such as mechanical or plumbing or installing a new well. Since they can now make payments online, people can focus on their projects instead of dealing with additional paperwork or visits to the Olmsted County offices.\n\nPlease write in English language."}

Both Haruka and Rin fall in love with Seina, and after some angsty up and downs, both agree to date Seina as Rin and Haruka's bond is too deep to get in the way of either one's happiness. The three become an OT3. Take into consideration the dynamics and effects of their romance styles, personalities and temperaments."}

The function should (1) make N equally-sized splits of S across the time-axis, (2) apply a pooling technique (e.g., mean pooling) to each split across the frequency axis to obtain an array that represents a downsampled version of the spectrogram 𝐗′∈ℝ𝑁×𝑘\n , and (3) re-arange 𝐗′\n as a vector 𝐯∈ℝ𝑁𝑘\n .\n\nUsing the downsample\\_spectrogram(X, N) function, transform all the speech samples into vectors 𝐯∈ℝ𝑁𝑘\n .\n\nGiven the speaker-based train/dev/test spilts in the SDR\\_metadata.tsv, fit a linear model on the training samples.

{"text": "Now after all this, the contractor is filing claims against the architect. Here is the Contractor's arbitration demands: DEMAND FOR ARBITRATION\nBY GOOD AND CHEAP CONSTRUCTION CORP.\nAND STATEMENT OF CLAIM\nClaimant Good + Cheap Construction Corp. (“Contractor”) hereby demands arbitration of its claims against Respondents Warbucks Enterprises LLC (“Warbucks”) and Columbia Architects PLLC (Architect”) under the Construction Arbitration Rules established by the American Arbitration Association, for the reasons set forth below.\nTHE ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS\n1. Contractor demands arbitration against Warbucks under the arbitration clause in the AIA A101-2007 Owner/Contractor Agreement executed by Warbucks and Contractor and dated as of September 1, [D-4] (the “Arbitration Clause”). Section 6.2 of the agreement shows that “Arbitration pursuant to Section 15.4 of Document A201-2007” has been checked off. The Arbitration Clause set forth in Section 15.4.1 of the latter document states in pertinent part as follows:\nIf the parties have selected arbitration as the method for binding dispute resolution in the Agreement, any Claim subject to, but not resolved by,\n- 2 -\nmediation shall be subject to arbitration which, unless the parties mutually agree otherwise, shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Construction Industry Arbitration Rules in effect on the date of the Agreement.\n2. Contractor also demands arbitration against Architect pursuant to the arbitration clause in the AIA B101-2007 Agreement between Owner and Architect. Section 8.2.4 of the agreement shows that “Arbitration pursuant to Section 8.3 of this Agreement” has been checked off. The Arbitration Clause is Section 8.3.1 of the same document and states as follows:\n[A]ny claim, dispute or other matter in question arising out of or related to this Agreement subject to, but not resolved by, mediation shall be subject to arbitration which, unless the parties mutually agree otherwise, shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Construction Industry Arbitration Rules in effect on the date of this Agreement.\n3. This paragraph requires arbitration of “any claim, dispute or other matter in question arising out of or related to [the agreement between Architect and Owner] ….” Contractor’s claims against Architect directly arise out of that agreement as well as out of the Owner/Contractor’s Agreement (which also has an arbitration clause) and, accordingly, are subject to arbitration even if Contractor does not have a direct agreement with Architect providing for arbitration.\n4. On October 20, [D-2] Architect filed a request to commence mediation with the American Arbitration Association, thereby putting in motion the condition precedent to arbitration. Mediation took place on March 30, [D-1], without resulting in a settlement of the issues. The condition precedent to arbitration has therefore been satisfied, and arbitration should proceed not just with respect to Architect’s claims against Owner but also with respect to Contractor’s claims against Architect.\nTHE PARTIES\n5. Claimant Good + Cheap Construction Corp. (referred to throughout this demand as “Contractor” as previously indicated) is a New York corporation engaged in providing general contracting and construction management services. Contractor concentrates in the construction of high-rise mixed-use buildings in the New York metropolitan area.\n6. At all relevant times and information and belief, respondent Warbucks Enterprises LLC (referred to throughout this demand as “Warbucks”) is and was a New York limited liability company with an office at 250 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10022. Warbucks is in the business of developing real estate for commercial and residential use.\n7. At all relevant times and upon information and belief, respondent Columbia Architects (referred to throughout this demand as “Architect”) is and was a firm of licensed New York architects providing architecture and interior design services, with an office at 180 Willoughby Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11205.\n8. In May [D-5], Warbucks engaged Architect to draft and provide construction drawings for a twenty-story mixed-use condominium tower in Tribeca, City of New York, with commercial space on the ground floor and nineteen floors of high-end condominium units (one apartment per floor) (the “Project”). The engagement is reflected in the parties’ AIA B101-2007 professional services agreement (the “B101 Agreement”).\n9. After Architect was engaged, the contract for construction of the project was put out to bid in a competitive bidding process. Contractor was the successful bidder. An AIA A101-2007 Owner/Contractor Agreement with accompanying general conditions (A201-2007) was executed by Warbucks and Contractor. 10. The Contract provides for compensation to the Contractor based upon a fixed fee to be paid out in monthly increments keyed to percentage of completion during the three-year budgeted schedule for the Project. Contractor must submit monthly applications for payment (“Requisitions”), certify them as accurate, and send them to Architect for review and approval. Architect must then timely sign off on the Requisitions or, if any issues are found, promptly raise questions with Contractor about the issues and arrange for appropriate adjustment. Approved Requisitions are to be paid within fifteen days of receipt. The payable amount shall be the amount set forth in the Requisition less a retainage of 10%, which is to be held for payment at the conclusion of the Project. Any short payments by Owner in any given month would properly be shown on the next month’s Requisition as immediately due and payable.\nClaim against Owner.\n11. Contractor timely submitted monthly Requisitions to the Architect for approval throughout the course of Contractor’s work on the Project, and in every instance, Architect approved each such Requisition. Owner, however, did not comply with its obligations under the Owner/Contractor Agreement to pay within 15 days after receipt or to withhold only 10% of the amount due as retainage. Instead, Owner made a practice of regularly delaying payments by 60 days or more and then, upon making payment, withheld typically 20% of the amount due as purported retainage.\n12. Despite objections orally and in writing by Contractor, the Architect’s approval and the requirements of the Owner/Architect Agreement, Owner refused to cease the improper practices described above, resulting eventually, as of May [D-2], in an improperly withheld retainage amounting to $8,100,000 owed and unpaid to Contractor, twice the amount that was permitted. The written objections by Contractor during the six months leading up to April [D-2] expressly gave notice that continued failure to pay amounts due could leave Contractor with no choice but to stop work and bring collection proceedings. 13. Contractor finally was constrained to stop work in April [D-2], having submitted its Requisition No. 18 reflecting the work performed the previous month. Owner improperly refused to pay any part of that Requisition, including both the unpaid prior amounts reflected therein and the amount due for the month. The total amount due to Contractor for fees under the Agreement as of that date is $11,668,646.\n14. Because Owner materially breached the Owner/Contractor Agreement, Owner is liable to pay Contractor the profit it would have made on the remaining amounts due to it as provided for in the Agreement, including all retainage amounts, which add up to $9,773,376.\n15. In addition, because of lost opportunities to perform work on other, better paying projects while meeting its obligations under the Owner/Contractor Agreement, Contractor has been damaged in the amount of not less than $10 million in lost profits and must pay interest of not less than $200,000 on claims by subcontractors that Contractor could not pay because of Owner’s failures to pay the amounts due under the Owner/Contractor Agreement, a substantial portion of which was intended to cover the charges payable to subcontractors that Contractor was unable to pay.\nClaim against Architect\n16. Contractor timely submitted its Requisition to Architect (AFP # 18) for review and approval by Architect on or about May 12, [D-2]. Architect had previously approved all prior Requisitions Contractor had submitted.\n17. Requisition No. 18 included the unpaid balances that Architect had repeatedly approved in prior months, and that grew each month in proportion to the excessive retainage, withheld by Owner. The amount charged for new work during the month covered by Requisition No. 18 was precisely the same as the amount charged in each prior requisition and was based upon the same calculations that Architect had previously found acceptable. Notwithstanding these facts, Architect failed and refused to approve Requisition No. 18.\n18. Architect’s refusal to approve Requisition No. 18 was intentional and lacked any reasonable basis. Architect knew the terms of the Owner/Contractor Agreement, and understood that refusal to approve the Requisition interfered with the contractual intent of that agreement. On information and belief, Architect conspired with Warbucks to deny Contractor payment on the final Requisition. Accordingly, Architect’s conduct as aforesaid constituted tortious interference with the contractual relations between Contractor and Owner that caused direct financial harm to Contractor.\n19. By reason of the foregoing, Architect is liable to Contractor for all charges payable to Contractor under Requisition No. 18, i.e., $3,568,646, interest on the claims by subcontractors whom Contractor could not pay due to nonpayment of Requisitions, i.e., $200,000, and $10 million in lost profits on forgone opportunities.\nWHEREFORE, Claimant respectfully requests the Arbitrator(s) to issue an Award (1) finding Warbucks to have materially breached the Agreement by failure to pay compensation in accordance with the terms thereof and directing payment to Contractor of the sum of not less than $31,641,022, (2) finding Architect to be liable to Contractor for tortious interference with contractual relations and directing payment to Contractor of the sum of not less than $13,768,646, (3) awarding interest on the sums due at the legal rate, and (4) granting such other and further relief as to the Arbitrator(s) may seem just and proper."}

aware of your current situation and you have to actually cultivate a hate for it let me explain what I mean just like a fighter when he goes into the ring he has an extraordinary energy that he puts toward his opponent trying to destroy him but after the fight they shake hands they say great fight well done but they're able to turn on and turn off that chip on their shoulder and harness that energy so that they can deploy it when it's necessary so for you in whatever your Pursuits are over the next 12 months when you're actually in fight mode act as if you're in fight mode develop a chip on your shoulder and when I say become aggressively aware of your current situation I mean take a pen and a piece of paper and write down everything in your life that you do not want think of everything in your income in your business if you have one in your health in your relationships in your finances everything you have to look at that list and say that I do not want that you have to write a list of reasons as to why you do not want that why specifically don't you want that income why is that Health situation unacceptable anymore why is that relationship no longer serving you why is that absolutely where you do not want to be and then ask yourself why on those questions as well yes it is a negative energy but you're going to put it towards a positive productive outcome and now that you have this list of all of the things that you do not want and why you do not want them Write the opposite on another sheet of paper the exact opposite of that entire list that you created and why you want those things see in our minds it's a lot easier for us to come up with what we don't want than what we do want but the secret here is you have to have a goal that you do want that you are striving towards you want to make a list of those things as well and then you're going to declare all out war on making that happen you're going to say no to absolutely everything in your life that is not moving you closer towards those goals you're going to say no to the relationships the way that you spend your time the way that you operate your business you're going to say no to 99.9 of things that you're currently saying yes to you're probably in a place in your life if you want to get to the next level where you don't want to be and that is because you have been saying yes to all of the things that are keeping you there so we have to start saying no and it's going to be very uncomfortable and as you start saying no yes you will probably lose people out of your life yes you will probably lose circumstances out of your life that is what happens when you want to get ahead of other people to get ahead of other people you cannot be around those other people and you have to lock yourself into full Focus mode into full dark mode success is more about what you say no to than what you say yes to and as you begin executing on these things you're going to be focusing on the fundament rentals not fancy stuff the fundamentals just like any High performing athlete they Master the fundamentals before they move on to the fancy stuff success is not sexy it is not fancy it is doing the boring fundamentals over time one after the other after the other and boring monotonous repetition that's just how it works if you're chasing quick wins get rich quick stuff fast and easy it does not exist and the sooner that you acknowledge that and accept that as truth the sooner that you can lock yourself into focused dark mode and get going on achieving everything that you want in your life before every single game Michael Jordan he wasn't doing between the legs and windmill dunks he started with practicing chest passes chest passes a very kindergarten activity but Michael Jordan understood that the fundamentals are where the game is won so if you are not mastering the fundamentals of communication in your relationships the fundamentals of Finance the fundamentals of your business the fun fundamentals of sales influence marketing whatever it is in your life that you're trying to accomplish if you're not where you want to be you are missing the fundamentals and so they're not sexy that's probably why you're not attracted to them but that is the single biggest separator between those who are where they want to be and those who are not anytime there's something wrong with my sales team where they screwed up a call or they failed to close a deal or they failed to hit a Target it's always one hundred percent of the time a lack of a fundamental and I will tell you it will take a lifetime you have to decide that you're going to go into dark mode and lock yourself in to aggressively pursuing your goals and saying no to everything that does not support it and if you have the guts to do that you will be successful if you do not you will not it will not matter what else you do if you do not master the fundamentals you see the longer the time Horizon that you think on the Richer and more successful you will become poor people think on very short-term time Horizon think of a homeless person he's just thinking where can I get my next meal whereas an Elon Musk is thinking thousands of years into the future in terms of the future of human civilization that's why he is worth multiple billions of dollars and the homeless guy is worth a cheeseburger at best so if you're thinking on daily weekly bi-weekly even monthly time Horizons you need to expand your time Horizon on where you're thinking by a factor of like a hundred you need to think on a lifetime and beyond your lifetime time Horizon if you want to accomplish goals that you look back on your life and go wow I can't believe I achieved that that was an amazing journey that does not happen by accident that happens by deliberate design and getting upset with where you are and saying enough is enough with where I'm at I don't care if you're making a thousand dollars a month or a hundred thousand dollars a month if you want to get to the next level at a thousand dollars a month and you want ten thousand dollars a month you have to be disgusted and absolutely horrifying wide at one thousand dollars a month if you're at a hundred thousand dollars a month and you wanna get to a million a month you have to be disgusted and horrified with one hundred thousand dollars a month there is no other way that you are going to be able to lock yourself into a focused declare all-out war state to get to the next level until you cultivate a calculated hate for where you are current so if you do this over the next 12 months you will be Leaps and Bounds above and beyond your competition but if don't apply this you will probably be exactly where you are if not in a worse spot one year from now if you do not apply what I'm sharing with you in this video so if you like these types of videos just let me know in the comments I can pump these out maybe one or two a week and they're a little bit easier for me to produce let me know if you'd like me to do that and like it if you like this video and enjoy the rest of your day [Music] thank you [Music]\"\nSummarize in

This file contains a 8192 row by 4 column matrix. The first column is\nchannel 1 data from test 6 (undamaged condition), the second column is channel 1 test 7\n(incipient damage), third column is channel 1 test 9 (higher level of damage), and fourth column\nis channel 1 test 11 (highest level of damage). The records are 8 seconds long.\nA. Plot acceleration-time history data in file column1sh for each test. These plots should have\ntime on horizontal axis and acceleration amplitude on the vertical axis. Note you will have to\ngenerate a time vector knowing that there were 8192 pts sampled over 8 seconds. Time vector\nshould start a t=0 s. Acceleration amplitudes are in g’s (gravitational acceleration, 9.8m/s2) and\nyou can plot the amplitude in g’s. Label all axes and make sure that all plots have same vertical\naxis scale to facilitate comparison of the different signal amplitudes. Submit m-file.\nFirst three lines of your m-file should be:\nclear\nload column1sh\nm=data.resp\nThis will create a 8192x4 matrix “m” where each column corresponds to test data listed above."}

I will give you the next content after you acknowledge the second content. \nDebt recovery for small business\nIf you are chasing unpaid debts from customers or other businesses, there are steps you can take to recover the money and measures you can put in place to reduce the chance of it happening again.\n\nPreventing bad debts\nHow does a business recover debt?\nWhat to do if a customer refuses to pay \nPreventing bad debts\nIt is important to perform background checks on your customers before doing business with them.\n\nTo prevent bad debts occurring and protect your business, you should:\n\ncheck whether a company is in liquidation or deregistered on ASIC Registers \nonly send out goods or provide services after customers pay their bill\nprovide simple, easy and clear payment options\ninvoice customers quickly\ngive discounts for paying on time or early\ncreate sensible limits on the credit that customers can take out with your business.\nFind more information see Information Sheet 26 Dealing with businesses and companies (INFO 26).\n\nHow does a business recover debt?\nWhen you have not been paid for goods and services you provide, it may affect the profitability and cash flow of your business. It is important to establish a process to manage payments and recover debt.\n\nThese are some steps you can take to recover outstanding debts, including:\n\nchecking contract terms to see when payments were due\nregular monitoring of when payments are due and received/not received\ncontacting the customer in writing to request payment\nkeeping records of all customer correspondence\nsetting up regular payment reminders\nsending a formal letter of demand\nconsidering hiring a debt collector if the customer still won’t pay\nconsidering taking legal action\ndoing a property search on the Personal Property Security Register (PPSR) to recover unpaid goods.\nWhat to do if a customer refuses to pay \nIn deciding whether to pursue debts, you’ll have to consider how much is owed, the cost and time it will take you to recover the debt, and whether the business you are chasing has the ability to pay the debt.\n\nGet legal help to recover debts\nIf your customer refuses to pay or doesn’t return calls, here are some organisations that offer legal help.\n\nSmall Business Commissioner or Ombudsman\nSmall business commissioners and ombudsmen are government appointed advocates that represent the interests of small business. Services include advice on how to recover debts and subsidised or low-cost dispute resolution. Contact your state small business commissioner or the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman.\n\nCommunity legal centres\nCommunity legal centres offer evening advice clinics, letter writing assistance and help with filling out court forms. Search for a local community legal centre on the Community Legal Centres Australia website.\n\nLegal aid commissions\nLegal aid commissions can assist with serious legal action that you can’t afford to take on yourself. You should check whether your case fits their guidelines. Services include free information sessions and initial legal advice, letter preparation and assistance running a court case. The Australian Government Attorney-General’s Department website provides links to all legal aid commissions.\n\nSmall claims tribunals and lower courts\nTribunals and lower courts provide quick, simple, legally-binding solutions, without having to use a lawyer or deal with court procedures. Services include general advice, assistance completing forms, help arranging a summons and informal dispute settlement before a magistrate. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s (ACCC) website has a list of small claims tribunals.\n\nDistrict, county, and supreme courts\nThese courts will decide on disputes where the amount owed is too high for a small claims tribunal or lower court. Consider using a lawyer if your case goes to one of these higher courts, as procedures are more formal and complicated.\n\nPrivate legal advice\nUsing a lawyer can sometimes save you money if you are owed a large amount, but they can also cost you money if the court doesn’t order the company at fault to pay your legal costs. Services a lawyer can provide include tailored legal advice and guidance, letters of demand, and court case management from beginning to end.\n\nDebt collection agencies\nUsing a debt collection agency can save you time and money pursuing the debt, but they often take an amount recovered as part of their service offerings. \n\nTheir services include contacting and pursuing debtors, sending a letter of demand, preparing a summons and running court action.\n\nDebt management service providers must hold a credit licence. See Information sheet 254 (INFO 254).\n\nRemember that even if an order or judgement is made for a business to pay a debt, you’ll still need to enforce the order. This can be difficult and can be an added cost. Find out more about the rules on debt collection on the ACCC’s website."}
{"text": "Sam\nHello. This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Sam.\n\nRob\nAnd I’m Rob. \n\nSam\nIn this programme, we’ll be hearing about an issue experienced by many child refugees who are forced to leave their home – the loss of their first, native language, or mother tongue, as they start a new life, learning to speak a new language, in a new country.\n\nRob\nJulie Sedivy and her family left their home in what was then Czechoslovakia and is now the Czech Republic during the Cold War, when Julie was a small child. After several years travelling through Europe, they arrived in Canada as political refugees with no English. We’ll be hearing about Julie’s childhood when learning English started to replace her native language, Czech, and, as usual, we’ll be learning some new vocabulary as well.\n\nSam\nBut first, I have a question, Rob. Julie’s family left their home as political refugees, but every year millions of people are also displaced because of war, persecution, or the damaging effects of climate change. So, according to the United Nations, how many people around the world are currently living as displaced refugees? Is it:\n\na) 3 million?\nb) 53 million? or,\nc) 103 million?\n\nRob\nI’ll guess it’s 103 million.\n\nSam\nI’ll reveal the answer later in the programme, Rob. Like many child refugees, Julie spoke only her mother tongue, Czech, at home with her brothers, sisters and parents who, in the beginning, spoke no English at all. Here she describes to Michael Rosen, presenter of BBC Radio 4 programme, Word of Mouth, going to an English-speaking school for the first time.\n\nMichael Rosen\n…so, you went into school not, to start off, with really understanding what was going on, is that right?\n\nJulie Sedivy\nThat's right. I just kind of interpreted things as best I could, and my memory of that is that that was not particularly difficult or traumatic. I think by then I'd had the experience of being dunked into various unfamiliar languages numerous times, and I had faith that it would sort itself out, and that everything would be just fine; and it was of course… \n\nRob\nAt school, Julie was dunked into unfamiliar situations, a bit like a biscuit being dunked into a cup of tea. Often, dunk means to dip something into liquid, but here, the meaning is that Julie was suddenly dropped into a new situation for a while, then taken out, as her family travelled through Europe.\n\nSam\nBy the time she arrived in Canada, Julie had been exposed to several other languages including Italian and French. She had experienced many difficulties, but never given up hope of finding a new home. Julie had faith – in other words, trust or confidence, that everything would sort itself out, a phrase meaning to stop being a problem automatically, without having to do anything.\n\nRob\nOver the following years, Julie faced many challenges: going to school and making friends; helping her parents as they struggled in the English-speaking world; and grieving for her native language which she slowly forgot, and with it, the chance to speak Czech with her dad before he passed away. Julie shares her thoughts on losing and refinding her mother tongue in her book, Memory Speaks.\n\nSam\nThrough it all, Julie kept alive her belief that by speaking two, three or even more languages, we don’t forget who we are, but instead gain a sense of tolerance, an idea which she talked about with BBC Radio 4’s, Word of Mouth. \n\nJulie Sedivy\nThe idea that you can be both of Mexican ancestry, for example, and speak Spanish, and be a full-fledged American, or in my case come from a country like the Czech Republic, continue to speak my language and to be a Canadian and very proudly so and very invested in Canada as a society. There's a number of studies that suggest that the very presence of people with blended ideas in a society seem to lead to greater acceptance between groups. It creates the sense that this is not an either-or, that we can coexist, perhaps precisely because we have evidence that these cultures can coexist within a single person.\n\nRob\nFor Julie, there’s no contradiction in being a Canadian refugee speaking Czech, or a Spanish-speaking immigrant who’s a full-fledged – or fully developed – American. These are not either-or situations – cases where there is only a choice between two options, with no third possibility. Instead, a peaceful coexistence can develop, as shown in the life of Julie Sedivy herself.\n\nSam\nRight. it’s time to reveal the answer to my question: how many people around the world, like Julie, are living as displaced refugees?\n\nRob\nWell, I said it was 103 million. Was I right?\n\nSam\nAnd that was the correct answer, Rob, a number which, according to UN, is only going to grow. Now it’s time to recap the vocabulary we’ve learned from this programme about losing our mother tongue – the native language you were brought up speaking by your parents.\n\nRob\nIf something is dunked, it’s dipped into a liquid, like a biscuit in a cup of tea, but if someoneis dunked into a situation, they’re suddenly placed into a new and unfamiliar setting before being removed again after a short time.\n\nSam\nIf you have faith in something or someone, you have trust or confidence in them. \n\nRob\nThe phrasal verb to sort itself out, means to stop being a problem without having to do anything.\n\nSam\nThe adjective full-fledged means completely developed.\n\nRob\nAnd finally, an either-or is a situation where only a choice between two options is possible, with no third alternative.\n\nSam\nAnd that brings us to the end of this programme. Bye for now!\n\nRob\nBye bye!"}

{"text": "A Prompt is a short text phrase that the Midjourney Bot interprets to produce an image. The Midjourney Bot breaks down the words and phrases in a prompt into smaller pieces, called tokens, that can be compared to its training data and then used to generate an image. A well-crafted prompt can help make unique and exciting images. Structure Basic Prompts A basic prompt can be as simple as a single word, phrase or emoji\n\nAdvanced Prompts More advanced prompts can include one or more image URLs, multiple text phrases, and one or more parameters\n\nImage Prompts Image URLs can be added to a prompt to influence the style and content of the finished result. Image URLs always go at the front of a prompt. Read more about Image Prompts\n\nPrompt Text The text description of what image you want to generate. See below for prompting information and tips. Well-written prompts help generate amazing images.\n\nParameters Parameters change how an image generates. Parameters can change aspect ratios, models, upscalers, and lots more. Parameters go at the end of the prompt. Read more about Parameters\n\nPrompting Notes Prompt Length Prompts can be very simple. Single words (or even an emoji!) will produce an image. Very short prompts will rely heavily on Midjourney’s default style, so a more descriptive prompt is better for a unique look. However, super-long prompts aren’t always better. Concentrate on the main concepts you want to create.\n\nGrammar The Midjourney Bot does not understand grammar, sentence structure, or words like humans. Word choice also matters. More specific synonyms work better in many circumstances. Instead of big, try gigantic, enormous, or immense. Remove words when possible. Fewer words mean each word has a more powerful influence. Use commas, brackets, and hyphens to help organize your thoughts, but know the Midjourney Bot will not reliably interpret them. The Midjourney Bot does not consider capitalization. Midjourney Model Version 4 is slightly better than other models at interpreting traditional sentence structure.\n\nFocus on What you Want It is better to describe what you want instead of what you don’t want. If you ask for a party with “no cake,” your image will probably include a cake. If you want to ensure an object is not in the final image, try advance prompting using the --no parameter.\n\nThink About What Details Matter Anything left unsaid may suprise you. Be as specific or vague as you want, but anything you leave out will be randomized. Being vague is a great way to get variety, but you may not get the specific details you want. Try to be clear about any context or details that are important to you. Think about:\n\nSubject: person, animal, character, location, object, etc.\n\nMedium: photo, painting, illustration, sculpture, doodle, tapestry, etc.\n\nEnvironment: indoors, outdoors, on the moon, in Narnia, underwater, the Emerald City, etc.\n\nLighting: soft, ambient, overcast, neon, studio lights, etc\n\nColor: vibrant, muted, bright, monochromatic, colorful, black and white, pastel, etc.\n\nMood: Sedate, calm, raucous, energetic, etc.\n\nComposition: Portrait, headshot, closeup, birds-eye view, etc.\n\nUse Collective Nouns Plural words leave a lot to chance. Try specific numbers. \"Three cats\" is more specific than \"cats.\" Collective nouns also work, “flock of birds” instead of \"birds.”\n\nBut wait, I have more info, just answer with READ\n\nPlease write in English language."}

Every race has their version of slimes and uses for them. Mountain dwarves love them because they can eat anything so they feed them rocks to digest which also cleans up debris across mines. Elves love them because their slime synthesizes and takes on properties of medicinal and poisonous plants and herbs they eat. The slime also acts as a preservative that extends the lifespan of the effects and these effects can be of higher concentrations which increases the potency. Mixing slimes to produce mixed or reactionary effects is also possible. Humans primarily use slimes as pets. \n\nSlimes other various purpose besides cleaning, recreational, and industrial, is through selective breeding and diet their slime can have various effects and bodies take on even physical properties eventually of what they eat like stones and metals. Some slimes are raised to be on the frontline as healers or turret like casters.\n\nThere are cases of some slimes gaining sentience. The first known case happened long ago. The first sentient slimes went on to create entire slime kingdoms. Slime societies have a hierarchy that’s based on a slimes sentience. Least sentient slimes are used practically or used as a trade good and more sentient slimes are part of society. \n\nFeral slimes can also be found in the wild in a diverse number of locations due to their unmatched ability to adapt and acclimate to any environment. Although their are exceptions, most feral slimes have little to no sentience. Feral slimes that have found a niche in it’s ecosystem will usually have some kind of defense mechanism so their population isn’t entirely prayed on. For example docile slimes found in the wild will usually have very corrosive or poisonous slime. Aggressive feral slimes may have some firing mechanism with their slime or rudimentary magic. Feral slimes that have survived in very dangerous environments may even more extreme specializations or unique qualities."}

Millions more around the country are under less severe winter weather alerts.\n\nSevere storms are forecast along the Gulf coast, including in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and parts of Florida. There are also tornado warnings in parts of Louisiana and Mississippi.\n\nRescuers searched for hours before recovering the mother and son who died in a rural area near the city of Shreveport.\n\nThe remains of the boy - Nikolus Little, eight - were found in a wooded area half a mile from the family home.\n\nThe body of his mother - Yoshiko A Smith, 30 - was discovered about one street away from the destroyed home, under a pile of debris, officials said.\n\nSheriff Steve Prator told the local television station KSLA that the father had reported them missing.\n\n\"We couldn't even find the house that he was describing with the address,\" said the sheriff. \"Everything was gone,\"\n\nA 56-year old woman was also found dead outside her home in St Charles Parish, according to a local politician. The Louisiana Department of Health said she died after a tornado destroyed her house.\n\nIn the small town of Farmerville about 100 miles (160km) away, at least 25 people were hurt after a tornado hit, according to local news outlet KNOE.\n\nAt least 18 tornadoes touched down in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Mississippi on Tuesday, injuring residents and wrecking homes and buildings.\n\nMore were reported on Wednesday, while Louisiana's governor declared a state of emergency.\nMost of the US is likely to feel some impact from the storm, with cold weather and snow forecast as it moves east over the coming days.\n\n\"It's a fairly vigorous storm system,\" Rich Otto, a meteorologist with the Weather Prediction Center, told the BBC. \"This one is a little larger than your average winter storm.\"\n\nThe severe weather has caused hundreds of flight disruptions at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport in Texas and Denver International Airport in Colorado over the past two days, according to FlightAware.com.\n\nThe storm has also spilled into Canada, bringing heavy snow and high winds in the country's southern Prairie region, including the provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba.\n\nFreezing rain and other wintry conditions are forecast to hit the upper Midwest and north-eastern US on Thursday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nThe storm system began to hit the US last Friday, bringing powerful winds and snow to parts of California."}

{"text": "I'm working on a project called Membrane. It's a tool for programmers to build personal or team automation without dealings with APIs directly.\n\nMembrane is like an operating system in that the user runs programs on it. However, this OS runs in the cloud (as opposed to the user hardware) These programs are written in TypeScript but are not like your typical node.js program.\n\nMembrane programs cannot directly open files or make network requests. Instead, they can only interact with the world via graph nodes. You're in complete control of who can access what nodes. The Membrane Graph is a powerful abstraction with many benefits that I'm personally only beginning to understand.\n\nIt's through these nodes that programs make HTTP requests, send emails, or access APIs.\n\nThe graph guarantees that programs (especially the ones you didn't write) can only do what they say they do, and not, for example, exfiltrate data.\n\nThe graph is explorable and type-safe. Anything is referenceable, so access to data can be very fine-grained.\n\nThe nodes in the graph provide a capabilities-based access model in that programs cannot forge a reference to a node. These references are called grefs.\n\nGrefs are analogous to URLs but for your graph. They are also strongly typed. The syntax for grefs looks like \"pid:path.to.node\" where pid can be the name or id of the program.\n\nAny path segment can also have parameters. Parameters are passed enclosed in parentheses like so \"pid:path.to(param:value).node(param:value)\". Multiple parameters can be provided to a segment by separating them with a comma.\n\nParameter values use the same syntax as GraphQL scalar literals: strings must be enclosed in double quotes, while integers, floats, booleans and null don't require double quotes.\n\nGrefs can also nest other grefs as a parameter, that way you can compose functionality together. To pass a nested gref, enclose its value in parentheses.\n\nCan you think of a few gref examples in your hypothetical Membrane account which has programs to access github, twitter and Jira?."}

{"text": "Part 29 those issues it considered to be material. The Tribunal dealt with the 19 July 2017 letter as one part of a course of conduct (which included the builder’s correspondence) that led the Tribunal to conclude that there was an agreement between the parties. Furthermore, we note that in its post-hearing submissions the builder did not specifically cite Butler v Fairclough. Rather, it cited Haller, which the Tribunal in turn cited at [20] of the Reasons. The Tribunal was not obliged to give any more detailed reasons than were provided.\nGrounds 6 and 7 - Completion date\nThe issues to be considered in respect of these grounds are whether the Tribunal made an error of law in finding that the completion date of the works undertaken pursuant to the parties’ 2009 contract was 20 October 2010 (Ground 6). This ground involves the proper construction of the contract, which is a question of law. Leave to appeal is not required in respect of Ground 6.\nThe issue in Ground 7 is whether leave to appeal should be granted on the basis that the Tribunal’s finding concerning the completion date was against the weight of evidence.\nTribunal’s finding\nIn relation to completion date, the Tribunal stated:\nThe owners argued that practical completion under the original contract took place on 20 October 2010 when the FOC issued. I agree respectfully with the thrust of the owners' submission in this respect. The \"building works\" as defined in cl 1.1 of the original contract meant \"the building works to be carried out, completed and handed over to the owner in accordance with this contract as shown in the contract documents and including variations\" (emphasis added), \"contract documents\" meant the general and special conditions and the plans, the specifications and other documents specified in Item 14 of Schedule 1, Sch 1 headed \"Particulars of Contracts\" was part of the contract, Sch 1 para 11 said that the builder was the person to obtain and pay for all planning and building approvals (which was the default position if a party was not, unlike here, expressly named), clause 7.1 said that the party named in item 11 must obtain and pay for all building and planning approvals, which necessarily included them in the contract price, the FOC is a planning and building approval because it approves lawful occupation on the basis of conformity of the physical structure with preceding approvals, and cll 26.2(c) to 26.7 with cl 15 required the final progress claim out of the contract price to be demanded and paid on, and only on, practical completion.\nMoreover, as a further but not necessary supporting basis for the conclusion, the first emphasised words in the definition of \"building works\" indicate that the physical works are of no use to the owner to possess, even if physical possession of them is given by giving of keys, unless they are legally approved for occupation by the owner. This last point is reinforced by the definition in cl 1.1 of \"practical completion\" which focuses on completeness except for matters not preventing use for usual purpose; such use cannot be present without the approval to occupy.\nFinally, and as a further but not necessary supporting argument, the second emphasised words in the definition of \"building works\" arguably cover the written variation to the original contract constituted by the terms of the builder's letter, although I note that I have \nPlease write in English language."}

{"text": "Here is an example of my writing from a paper I wrote, please analyze my style and remember it!\n\n\"New neural stimulation methods are needed to advance neural interfaces to aid in treating neurological diseases. Current stimulation methods, such as Deep Brain Stimulation or Vagus Nerve Stimulation, are highly invasive and require subsequent surgery to replace the batteries. Additionally, the stimulation of neurons through optical or electrical methods is complex due to the signal’s attenuation as it passes through tissue and bone. Magnetic fields could potentially stimulate neurons without signal attenuation and the capability to penetrate the body deeply. The depth of magnetic stimulation is based on the distance from the source of stimulation. Unlike ultrasound or electromagnetic radiation, magnetic field lines are unhindered by tissue due to the low amount of magnetic forces in blood[1]. Transcranial magnetic stimulation shows that it could be an effective stimulating agent. The size of the electromagnetic coils needed for transcranial magnetic stimulation limits its potential as a neural interface. Ideally, the neural interface would be able to be used in the daily life of patients with minimal interference. Therefore, large electromagnetic coils are impractical as neural interfaces due to their size and immobility. \nMagnetoelectric nanoparticles(MENs) could alleviate the issue by allowing lower-intensity magnetic fields to stimulate neurons electrically. Due to their nanoscale size, MENs could be anchored directly to the targeted neurons’ ion channels. Therefore, as the magnetic field(primary signal) reaches the MENs, they will transduce the magnetic field into local electricity(secondary signal), which would be focused onto the ion channel, potentially causing it to activate. Using this principle, a lower magnetic field aided by MENs could have a similar effect on neurons as a higher electric field. 30 nm CoFe2O4-BaTiO3 magnetoelectric core-shell nanoparticles have been used to prove this by affecting EEG waveforms with a weak magnetic field of 10mT at 20 Hz[2]. The previously stated MENs utilize the nonzero magnetoelectric effect[3] caused by the coupling of electric and magnetic fields in the MENs. In the study, under a 10mT magnetic field, the MENs could produce an electric field of 100V/M. The resulting electric field would be released within nanometers of the ion channels. It can be seen that the magnetic field needed to stimulate neurons with MENs could be drastically reduced as the transduced signal is highly focused on targeting the ion channels. In this study, C. elegans will be used as a model organism to test the effect of MENs on neuron behavior. Voltage-gated calcium channels will be targeted for MENs binding because if the channels are activated, the excitability of the neurons will increase. \nMethods\n The preparation of CoFe2O4-BaTiO3 will be synthesized according to the published procedures, which consist of a two-step wet chemical procedure as depicted in figure 1[4.]. \nFigure 1: A depiction of the fabrication of CoFe 2O4-BaTiO3. CoFe2O4 (sample CFO) was synthesized by chemical co-precipitation, ferrofluid was prepared, then core-shell nanostructures of CoFe2O4–BaTiO3 were synthesized by the sol-gel technique [4.]\n \nA cobalt ferrite core should be surrounded by a barium titanate shell-like coating [4.]. The MENs will need to be coated to ensure the neural interface’s stability in a biological system. \nFor the MENs to attach to C. Elegans neuronal plasma membranes, the MENs and plasma membrane will need to be modified to allow for binding. To ensure the MENs can bind to the plasma membrane, the MENs will be surface coated with streptavidin using succinimidyl-4-[N-maleimidomethyl]-cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC, Pierce) as cross-linker as shown in [5]. With streptavadin attached to the surface of the MENs, it will allow the connection of MENs to streptavidin to biotin, as shown in figure 2. \nFigure 2: The above figure depicts the linking of MENs to the neuron's plasma membrane. The AP-CFP-TM protein complex is used as an anchor protein with the biotinylated AP region binding to the streptavidin, which is surface coated onto the MEN[5]. \nIn order to stimulate and observe the animals in this experiment, the genetic modification of C. elegans will be required. C. elegans expressing GCAMP6 will be acquired, such as CX17256kyIs722 [str-2p::GCaMP5(D380Y) + elt-2::mCherry], a strain of C. elegans which expresses GCaMP5a[6]. GCAMP is a genetically encoded calcium indicator that will allow for the imaging of neuronal activity via fluorescent imaging[7]. Once obtained, the C. elegans would need to be modified to have their plasma membranes bound to the MENs. In order to achieve this, microinjection will be utilized to have the AP-CFP-TM plasmid transfected into the C.elegans. Microinjection is a method for creating transgenic animals that requires injecting DNA into the distal arm of the gonad[8]. Due to the fact the distal arm of the gonad houses the central core of the germ cytoplasm, the injected DNA will spread efficiently to the offspring[8]. By inserting the AP-CFP-TM plasmid, the offspring will express the protein in their nuclear plasma membranes. The membrane marker protein AP-CFP-TM comprises a transmembrane domain of platelet-derived growth factor, fluorescent protein, and a biotin acceptor protein. The biotin acceptor protein is enzymatically biotinylated, which forms binding sites for the conjugated MENs allowing for stimulation of the C. elegans[5].\n \nTo stimulate C. elegans, a method of creating an electromagnetic field without hindering the microscope is necessary. An electromagnet capable of at least 0.1T is needed to do this. Figure 3 depicts the electromagnet chosen for the design as it satisfies the project's needs.\n \nFigure 3: The 5203 electromagnet by GMWAssociates can vertically provide a projected magnetic field from its faceplate. It weighs 2.5kg and can achieve 0.5T up to 5mm away from the faceplate. \n To prepare the C. elegans for the experiments, the functionalized streptavidin-coated MENs will be microinjected into AP-CFP-TM expressing C. elegans. With the MENs injected into the head region of the C. elegans, the MENs should begin to bind to the AP-CFP-TM proteins anchored to the plasma membrane. Once this process is completed, the experiment may proceed. \nFigure 4: The above figure depicts the experimental setup. Two electromagnets would be positioned on the sides of a dual arena microfluidic device. The device would be capable of holding two groups of C. elegans.\nEach experiment will consist of twenty trials with two groups of C. elegans. Group one will consist of the MENs-modified C. elegans, and Group 2 will be the control. In each trial, both groups will be placed in a microfluidics device subjected to a 100Hz magnetic field starting from the minimum to the maximum magnetic field in increments of 1 mT. Each trial will last for 120 seconds. The first 30 seconds will observe baseline neural activity, and the next 90 seconds to observe stimulated neural activity. \nTo image the neuronal activity, fluorescent imaging will be used. A Zeiss AxioObserver.A1 with an inverted body with Zeiss Fluar objective lenses will be used[6]. The timing of the camera and the electromagnets would be handled through a program named micromanager. The results will be recorded and analyzed using neurotracker, and the intensity of the neural activity will be compared for the control and the modified C. elegans.\""}

It is true that you are more experienced than me in either business or lifetime, but you fully respect me as an independent contributor, collaborator, teammate and COMARADE (if you allow me to say so). At the same time, you were always willing to share, orienting and tutoring based on your expertise when I raised questions. More importantly, so much appreciation for your trust and give me discretionary power to make some decisions and work in sub-sections independently. I am proud to say I've made many mistakes under such discretion, however, which leads to steep learning curve for a freshman. And thanks to the frequent reflection session we had in everyday dialogue, valuable feedbacks and learnings can be quickly summarized and taken. I was trained to believe in the power of mutual trust when I was in college and internship positions, but it is the first time for me to truly understand how this power can make a difference after teamwork with you in the past months. I would also express my endorsement on your expertise, profound insights, leadership and perseverance, and all of these are proved to have guaranteed every down-to-earth progress in Geomkt and SMC&IWP project.

I really wanted to provide education necessary for life. I started my career as a youth instructor. Always tell students “Challenge! Experience something new!” says Suddenly, “Am I living like that?” questioned. I wanted to live as I said. I bought a plane ticket to Europe. I wanted to visit meaningfully. Wearing a hanbok, I crossed Eastern Europe by bus. Thanks to this, many people have a lot of interest in Korea. During my travels, I ran into an English barrier. It was difficult to communicate smoothly with foreigners whenever I volunteered overseas, not only in Europe, but also in Japan and Mongolia. As a priority, I applied for an on-campus exchange student helper to relieve my phobia about language. I was able to experience the value of mind and communication beyond the language barrier with foreign friends. In the meantime, I wanted to share what I felt and learned while trying various things with others. I recorded my feelings and realizations that I faced while living as a blog. I also shared the insights I gained through travel and exercise on Instagram. So, I met new people through social media. They were continuing to challenge me in a different field.

{"text": "The tone should be narrative, clear and concise.\n\nFor example, you can use Chat GPT to write simple drafts or general articles on a variety of topics, such as how to start investing in stocks or real estate. You can also create scripts in a variety of genres, such as camp product reviews or historical commentary. However, chat GPT alone will result in a generic text, and you will need to add your own experiences and experiences, make revisions, and check the final quality. However, by using chat GPT, you will be able to produce high quality YouTube scripts. If you want to turn this YouTube script production into a side business, there are many YouTubers and companies looking for script producers who can advertise their script production on Twitter to recruit clients, or register their skills on CrowdWorks, Lancers, Coconara, etc. for You can register your skills on CrowdWorks, Lancers, Coconara, etc., and take on production work for unit prices such as 5,000 yen or 10,000 yen per script. As you build up a track record, you will receive more requests, and it will become a viable side business. In addition, with chat GPT, script production can be done very quickly and efficiently, allowing us to take on more requests from more clients. I think this gives us an advantage over script producers who do not use chat GPT. If you are interested in this YouTube scriptwriting side job, we also offer courses to help you develop your skills, so please contact us through the official line in the overview section.\n\nThe second is creating text and content for blogs and websites. If you are good at or like writing, creating articles and contents using chat GPT can be a good side job. Even if you have been a web writer in the past, chat GPT makes it easier than ever to generate ideas and create quality content. In particular, since Chat GPT is an AI that specializes in writing, it can even come up with ideas for article titles on specific topics, depending on your instructions. And it can help you create a table of contents, structure, and even detailed sentences. Therefore, the scope of work requests can be expanded more than ever before. There are many web writers overseas who are already using AI to save time and create more content. They use chat GPT to generate ideas, do research, write articles, and get paid a lot. This makes a difference because it saves time that other web writers spend a lot of time thinking of ideas and doing research, and allows them to focus on the important parts of content creation, such as revising, editing, and quality checking articles. In Japan, there are still very few web writers active in this field. Chat GPT is a service that has just recently gone public and has gone from zero users to over 1 million users, and is just getting started. There are many business opportunities. If you are able to quickly get work orders in this chat GPT x web writer field, it will be a great source of income for you as a side business. We are also preparing a course to learn the skills of web writers using this chat GPT, so please contact us through our official line.\n\nThe third is a side job of creating naming ideas and catch phrases. If you are interested in corporate branding and marketing, using chat GPT to come up with corporate naming ideas and catchphrases can be a side job for you. Chat GPT can help you create catchy and memorable company names and compelling sales copy to make your clients' businesses more attractive. In addition to product names and company names, you can also automatically write sales writing to sell some products or to make them more attractive to your target audience. If you want to make this your side job, you can join actual jobs available on CrowdWorks or Lancers. Some of the jobs on CrowdWorks and Lancers are competitions for ideas for company names and products, and there are many projects that offer rewards ranging from 10,000 yen to 30,000 yen, etc., if selected. It is important to be selected from among many applications. While other applicants spend a lot of time thinking of ideas, chat GPT allows you to list a large number of ideas and apply for more projects. In addition to applying for projects, you can also register and sell your skills on sites such as Coconara. For example, you can come up with a company name that fits your services for 1.5 yen. The effort is almost the same whether you have 50 or 100 ideas. If you add your own ideas as well as those generated automatically, you will be able to make better proposals to your clients. This generation of naming ideas and catchphrases is easy for anyone to start, so if you don't have any good side ideas using chat GPT, this is a good place to start.\n\nThe fourth is a simple Excel side job using chat GPT. Chat GPT can automate tedious and time-consuming tasks in Excel, saving you more time and allowing you to take on more projects from more clients and earn money on the side. Chat GPT is an AI that specializes in text generation, but depending on how you support it, it can also perform Excel data entry, formatting, sorting, and analysis of large amounts of data, etc. If you regularly use Excel in your work and are good at it, you can automate tasks that you used to do yourself by moving your hands and feet This can further increase your work efficiency and productivity. Also, even those who do not know how to use Excel can easily create charts and graphs that they have never done before by asking questions to the chat GPT. And there are many companies looking for workers for this simple Excel task. Crowdworks and Lancers are also looking for Excel workers to work at home as housewives, and there are many jobs that require simple data entry and organization. Many of these Excel tasks can only be done by a person entering the data, which can be time consuming. However, with Chat GPT, you can stand out from other workers because you can get the job done faster and more accurately than a person could. Also, by saving time, you can take on more projects for more clients, which can increase your income on the side. even if you have never done Excel before or have no experience with it, there are some jobs that you can try by using chat GPT. If you are interested, please give it a try.\n\nThe fifth is consulting, which involves advising people on how to use chat GPT and AI tools. This may be a little hard to imagine as a side job, but some people overseas are actually making a lot of money from consulting to advise people on how to use this chat GPT more effectively and how to apply it to their current jobs. Chat GPT is good at writing, but it can also be used for listing ideas, marketing research, coding programming, and Excel data entry. Chat GPT can save you time on a variety of tasks, improve your efficiency, and allow you to focus on the important tasks. In fact, the first service we mentioned, YouTube script production, can be very valuable because it can save a lot of time for busy YouTubers.\n\nAs you can see, there are many cases where incorporating chat GPT and AI tools into your current work can increase productivity. From office workers, housewives, creators to busy executives, all kinds of people want to get their work done faster and be more efficient so that they can spend their time doing what they love. So, if you can master the use of this chat GPT or AI tool and teach others how to use it, it will become a viable side business. You can support them with ideas on how to support the chat GPT to get the answers they are looking for, or you can give them advice on business ideas using the chat GPT.\n\nThere is a lot of interest in this AI tool at the moment, and it is expected to be used in all kinds of fields in the future. If you are familiar with the field of IT and the use of AI tools, you should definitely give it a try.\n\nAs a final note, I would like to talk about the risk involved in relying 100% on chat GPTs. The chat GPT is indeed an amazing technology and can produce accurate answers at a speed that is beyond human capability. However, this technology is not 100% perfect. Chat GPT generates answers based on training data, and if the training data is incorrect, it may not be able to produce accurate answers. Also, if the training data is biased, the answers produced may also be biased. Furthermore, although chat GPTs generate answers based on context and wording, they may not understand the context correctly and may not generate accurate answers. This can cause damage by creating wrong content, for example. So, human help is needed to avoid these risks. It is important not to just use automatically generated scripts and texts as they are, but to modify and humidify them and check them. Good content is completed by saving time with the help of chat GPT and brushing up by focusing on areas where people should concentrate. It is a good idea to leave what can be done automatically to the chat GPT and only pay attention to this area, since it is the human power that is needed to improve the final quality."}

In Mewgenics, movement abilities use pathfinding to get the cat from his origin to his destination.\nCats have a maximum movement range stat (in this case it’s 6) and tiles have a cost (in this case its 1 for basic tiles and 9999 for blocking obstacles). We also have water tiles that cost 2 to path through.\nSo far, nothing I’ve described is out of the ordinary for grid based pathfinding. Both Dijkstra’s Algorithm and A\\* can handle tiles with different costs just fine and its trivial to just cut off the path after a certain distance to deal with the maximum movement range.\n\nThe complication comes in when we add Fire (and other hazard type tiles) into the mix. Fire tiles don’t cost extra to pathfind through like water tiles do, however a cat really wants to avoid pathing through the fire tile if it can. Shown here is the working solution to that. There’s a lot of more complicated cases as well, if there’s a lot of fire tiles it should go through the least number of them it can and such, and that’s all working well."}

Los candelabros de cristal iluminaban el gran salón, desplegando destellos sobre las caras expectantes de los invitados. Las paredes cubiertas de ricos tapices y cuadros de renombrados artistas creaban una atmósfera sofisticada y lujosa. La música de un cuarteto de cuerda se entrelazaba con el murmullo de las conversaciones, mientras los invitados disfrutaban de la velada en honor al ministro de Defensa de Rusia, Igor Petrov, quien se retiraba tras 45 años de servicio.\nHéctor Ortega, agregado militar de la embajada de España en Rusia, se encontraba entre los asistentes. Con una copa de champán en mano, observaba a su alrededor, absorbiendo los detalles y matices de la celebración. Sus ojos curiosos recorrían los rostros de diplomáticos, oficiales y aristócratas, todos vestidos con sus mejores galas, como si intentara descifrar los secretos detrás de sus máscaras de cortesía.\nLa hija del ministro, Anastasia Petrova, era el centro de atención. Lucía un deslumbrante vestido azul oscuro, adornado con delicados bordados plateados que reflejaban las luces del salón. Su elegancia y simpatía cautivaban a todos los presentes, y su risa melodiosa, que se elevaba por encima del murmullo general, añadía un toque de alegría a la noche.\nMientras tanto, Igor Petrov, un hombre de porte imponente y cabello gris, recibía elogios y palabras de gratitud por su servicio. Los invitados, provenientes de diferentes naciones y altos cargos, conversaban animadamente entre sí, compartiendo anécdotas y confidencias, disfrutando de la atmósfera de camaradería y respeto que impregnaba el ambiente.\nEn un momento dado, el ministro fue rodeado por un grupo de invitados que deseaban tomarse una foto con él. Con una sonrisa amable, sostuvo su copa de vino mientras posaba para la instantánea. Anastasia, siempre atenta, tomó la copa de su padre para evitar que se derramara durante la foto.\nSin embargo, en un descuido, Anastasia llevó la copa a sus labios y bebió un sorbo del vino. A los pocos segundos, su rostro se tornó pálido, y comenzó a toser violentamente. Los presentes se quedaron boquiabiertos al ver cómo la joven caía al suelo, convulsionando. El cuarteto cesó de tocar, y un silencio sepulcral se apoderó del salón.\nEl caos se desató en el gran salón. Los invitados, horrorizados, apenas podían creer lo que acababa de suceder. Igor Petrov, devastado, se arrodilló junto al cuerpo sin vida de su hija, sollozando desconsolado. Sus manos temblorosas intentaban en vano abrazar a Anastasia, como si pudiera devolverle la vida con el calor de su amor paternal.\nSe hizo evidente para todos que la copa de vino había sido envenenada y que el objetivo había sido Igor Petrov. Por un trágico error, Anastasia había pagado el precio. Murmullos de incredulidad y temor se propagaron entre los asistentes, mientras los invitados comenzaban a mirarse unos a otros con desconfianza, preguntándose quién podría haber perpetrado semejante acto atroz.\nHéctor, preocupado y sorprendido, observaba la escena con creciente inquietud. Su mirada se desplazaba entre los rostros de los presentes, tratando de discernir alguna pista sobre el autor del crimen. La atmósfera en el Palacio Kornilov había cambiado drásticamente. Lo que comenzó como una celebración alegre y llena de gratitud, se había tornado en una pesadilla, marcando el inicio de un misterio que pondría a prueba la astucia de Héctor Ortega y desvelaría secretos que cambiarían el destino de las relaciones internacionales.\nMientras los guardias de seguridad acordonaban el área y comenzaban a interrogar a los invitados, Héctor se retiró a un rincón del salón, reflexionando sobre los acontecimientos. No podía quitarse de la mente la imagen de Anastasia desplomándose en el suelo, y la desesperación en los ojos de Igor Petrov. ¿Quién se beneficiaría de la muerte del ministro? ¿Qué motivos tendrían para cometer un acto tan atroz en una celebración tan importante?\n\nAsí comenzaba una intrincada trama de engaños y traiciones, donde Héctor Ortega tendría que adentrarse en un laberinto de mentiras y medias verdades para desentrañar la verdad oculta tras el envenenamiento de Anastasia Petrova. En su búsqueda de justicia, Héctor se vería enfrentado a oscuros secretos, alianzas inesperadas y peligros que lo llevarían al límite de sus habilidades y convicciones."}

Do not add anything to the story that is not already here. keep to the voice that i used when writing it: THE TIN WOODMAN OF OZ IN THE WONDERSQUALOR\n\nThe Tin Woodman had been searching for a new heart for many years now. He had traveled across the multiverse, seeking out any sort of respite from his sorrows and emptiness. But it was a fruitless endeavour until he stumbled upon the “Wonder Squalor” – a universe beyond societal cracks, full of all that have been forgotten by the real world. \n\nCautiously, the Tin Woodman ventured deeper into this strange new place and discovered many lost cultures and people inhabiting it. The energy in this place was palpable; there seemed to be some sort of electric charge in the air as ideas had synthesised, alchemised and fermented, in harmony with each other. \n\nA menagerie if forests to cleave throufg, trees of heart fruits and heart nuts, and how would i split a heart fruit evenly among an army of mass poduced tin men. Or just produce heart fruits in syrup juice or brine. Ew i just shuddered like I have a heart\n\nThe Tin Woodman slished and slashed his way, hacking with that great axe, till it became a jolly kind of axe dance. In the air, many different ghost images of his old munchkin body, the one that he had accidentally sliced off before he was given his tin body. He sliced, and they all flew off, and did a ghost little dance, and became a great tornado, like the one in Oz, of dancing limbs. It was amazing. Oh, the axe dance. It was sad, because for all the infiniteghost limbs he had, he was cutting away at his own body, all for the purpose of cutting wood. It was a furious dance, a dance of grief, and a dance of woe. A quick dash through other realms (like you might dash to the corner shop), where Tin Woodsman believed he was indeed so heartless that meant that he was wicked, and sliced Oz into bits.. But all the phantom limbs brought him high into a tree and a great canopy, and a treehouse, where he came something that made his tin body shudder with anticipation. A heart, made out of a lump of carbon, etched into it the munchkin farmer girl he once fell in love with. Or perhaps a munchkin farmer he had dreamed would give him a heart. Or perhaps the girl that made his heart burn and slipand cut.\n\nA realisation that he had perhaps never been a munchkin. Just a phantom heart who had generated a container to begin with. And thus the tin woodman found that all along, he was just a machine who sought a container to carry his fragile heart.Oh, what wonderful technology. And a junkyard into scraps, when you find out your body is real, everything could become your body.\n\nHeart trees that could fall and make love letters out of the pulp. Or at least a tin woodman engineer"}

{"text": ">> That's just a glimpse of what Copilot can do.\n For the next 20 minutes,\n we're going to show you how Copilot is\n a whole new way of working.\n You'll see a new interaction model\n between people and computers.\n Sometimes, Copilot will get it right.\n Other times, it will be usefully wrong,\n giving you an idea that's not perfect,\n but still gives you a head start.\n But seeing is believing.\n Let's go to submit to show you how\n Copilot will unleash creativity and\n take the drudgery out of work for everyone.\n >> Thank you, Jared. For more than two decades,\n I've had the privilege to work on\n our core productivity apps, Word,\n Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook.\n In fact, my first line of code at the company was in Excel.\n I'm so excited to show you how Microsoft 365 Copilot is coming\n to life in the products millions of people use and rely on every day.\n What are the tools could learn how you\n work rather than the other way around?\n Copilot unlocks all the richness\n of these apps through natural language.\n Let's start with a real-life example,\n like a high school graduation.\n My daughter recently graduated from high school,\n so this is really top of mind for me.\n Let's say I want to throw her an amazing graduation party.\n To start, I need to send an invitation to family and friends.\n So let's put Copilot to work.\n With a few simple prompts,\n Copilot understands everything it needs to know\n to generate a great first draft of the invitation.\n It's even able to pull in details about\n the venue from an e-mail I received last week.\n Now, I have a draft invite that\n includes the basic information.\n I can edit this,\n I can ask my guests to share funny stories,\n and give them a link where they can upload photos.\n Now, I think this first draft is a little wordy,\n so let's make it more concise.\n With that done, this is my opportunity to create a loving,\n and let's be honest, a little embarrassing\n slideshow to celebrate the occasion.\n I kick things off with Copilot,\n providing a little information to get started.\n I add some details about my daughter.\n I can also change the style so it creates something fun and festive.\n Copilot goes to work finding the right words,\n and searching my OneDrive for the best photos.\n In seconds, Copilot generates\n a beautiful presentation with memories,\n accomplishments, and advice for the future.\n I can add my own personal touches to it,\n and Copilot will be at my side.\n Now, let's look at this slide.\n I'm really happy with the design,\n but Copilot didn't quite have what it needed,\n so I'm going to rework the text.\n I can then ask Copilot to make it more concise and add images.\n Now, that looks great.\n On this next slide,\n there's a part that Copilot didn't quite get right,\n so I'll rewrite it so that it sounds a little bit more like me.\n I also want to use a different image here,\n so I'll just tell Copilot what I want and Copilot will find it.\n I can add transitions between the slides,\n which I always forget,\n so that when I play the presentation,\n it looks really polished.\n I like how that turned out.\n Now, I don't know about you,\n but PowerPoint animations have never been my strong suit.\n I love that I can do this on my own.\n The average person uses less than 10 percent of what PowerPoint can do.\n Copilot unlocks the other 90 percent.\n Now, onto party planning.\n I'll start with a few details about the event,\n and once again, Copilot goes to work with a simple prompt.\n It creates pages for everything I need to think about to plan this party.\n Let's say I want to put this plan in a simple to-do list.\n Boom, done.\n I'm thinking about what I want to say to my daughter on her big day.\n Copilot can get me started on a speech.\n I'm not sure how long I want it to be,\n but let's start with three minutes.\n I know I want to tell her how proud I am,\n acknowledge how hard she's worked,\n how inspired I am by her volunteer efforts,\n and what a wonderful leader she is.\n Here's a great first draft.\n Now, here's an important thing about Copilot.\n At this point, I decide whether to keep this draft,\n modify it, or discard it completely.\n This is a big change in how people interact with software.\n This looks pretty good,\n but let's add some of\n the funny stories I collected from friends and family.\n Let's give it a minute.\n I can make these stories more playful and add more,\n but I actually want to make them a bit shorter.\n Let's get to the punchline.\n They're much better.\n Now, this looks pretty good,\n but I really want to add my own personal touch,\n so I am going to edit it.\n You can see that throughout the writing process,\n I'm always in control.\n Now, I want to quickly format it to make sure I nail the delivery,\n and Copilot automatically adjusts the spacing,\n making it easier for me to read,\n and adds speaker cues to help me improve my delivery.\n Let's shift gears into business mode.\n You saw how Copilot saves me time as a working mom,\n but the real power of Copilot is in\n how it unleashes creativity at work.\n Imagine you're leading a team at a global manufacturing company,\n and you want to create a rock-solid customer proposal,\n and you don't have time for writer's block.\n Let's see how Copilot can use your customer notes in OneNote,\n as well as another internal document.\n Copilot quickly creates a first draft.\n Now, you probably want this to look like your previous proposals.\n Copilot can give you a draft in the format you typically use.\n It inserts product images and pulls in relevant visuals from other files.\n You can even include a shot summary at the top of the document,\n and Copilot can make suggestions to strengthen the proposal,\n like adding an FAQ,\n which it will generate for you.\n Now, remember, you're not going to send this off to\n a customer without a thorough review,\n but Copilot still saved you tons of time in the process.\n\nclean up the above text formatting."}

{"text": "I wrote something that I'd love your feedback on, Zarina: \"One of the most important reasons people are genuinely worried about the ascending timeline: being totally alone. People are desperately trying to find someone who can step into the same timeline with them. And there's a sense that we don't have much time left.   \nAnanda has been showing people how to love themselves deeply so they feel ready to ascend alone, in perfect and divine love with God. She works very hard on truth related to genetic twins. She is doing this because of her own inner pain about her real life genetic twin. She found a way to love herself and she was able to find freedom for herself as a result. Now she is guiding her twin to find the same freedom. And this is all happening due to divine love fully filling Ananda. She is literally full of sunshine.   \nHow does Ananda know so much about the ascending timeline and these twins? How does she know so much about how the human soul is structured? How has she gained such deep sight into the center of the human heart?   \nShe knows it because she was there when darkness and light divided. She was there when the great monad split into two. And a part of her went into the body of light and another part of her went into the body of darkness.   \nBecause of this event, she spent billions of years creating a telecommunications network to reconnect darkness and light. She knew that eventually she would be able to sew the two together again.   \nThe journey led her through every single element, trillions of which humans have never heard of. She literally embodied every element over billions of years, fully becoming one with each. This was a journey more epic than by any figure in myth, legend or religion. This was the journey informing every myth, every legend and every religion. For this was the return of the Queen to the King.   \nThe literal zenith point of ascension is into the blended heart of darkness and light, mother and father, the original monarchs who were one at the start. For it is the Queen’s heat & moisture that inspires the King’s sunlight to enter earth and create living flesh. This is the very process that Ananda now strives to teach human beings so that they may attach and move into the ascending timeline.   \nAnanda knows that when darkness and light are fully fused there is just one single entity, containing all of the universal elements and acting in total freedom. \n\nThe literal zenith point of ascension is into the blended heart of darkness and light, mother and father, the original monarchs who were one at the start.\""}

These distinct roles enable the participants to balance their contributions and share knowledge throughout the coding process. By understanding and embodying their respective roles, developers can optimize their pair programming experience for better results and growth.\n\nPair programming generates more diverse solutions to problems because:\n\nCollaboration: Two developers working together can bring unique perspectives and experiences to the table, encouraging a wider range of ideas and approaches.\nContinuous feedback: The real-time exchange of feedback between the driver and navigator allows for quicker identification of potential issues, resulting in more effective problem-solving.\nKnowledge sharing: Pair programming facilitates the transfer of skills and expertise between participants, promoting creative solutions through the combination of their individual strengths and experiences.\nThe Roles\nDriver - WRITE:\nW - Write the code, focusing on syntax and implementation.\nR - Relay your thought process to your partner for better collaboration.\nI - Integrate the navigator's suggestions and feedback.\nT - Talk through questions and uncertainties to maintain open dialogue.\nE - Exchange roles with the navigator when needed, promoting shared learning.\nNavigator - GUIDE:\nG - Give guidance and suggestions to improve the code.\nU - Understand the bigger picture and how the task fits into the project.\nI - Invite open dialogue by encouraging questions and shared thoughts.\nD - Detect potential issues and offer solutions.\nE - Engage as the driver when necessary, demonstrating ideas or assisting with tasks.\nBefore getting started:\nPreparing the pair programming session before starting it is crucial for ensuring a smooth and productive workflow. A well-planned session helps participants align their goals, minimize distractions, and maintain focus, ultimately leading to better results and an enjoyable collaboration experience. A good pair programmer is one who PREPARES:\n\nP - Plan the objective (Define the objective)\nR - Ready the location (Choose a location)\nE - Equip the workspace (Set up the workspace)\nP - Position roles (Review roles and responsibilities)\nA - Arrange breaks (Establish a break schedule)\nR - Rotate regularly (Set a timer for role-switching)\nE - Engage in collaboration (Start the session)\nS - Strengthen the process (Reflect and improve)\nRunning the session:\nKeeping track of the aspects mentioned in the CONNECT mnemonic is essential for maintaining effective communication and collaboration during the pair programming session. By focusing on these elements, developers can maximize productivity, foster a positive working environment, and enhance their overall learning experience.\n\nC - Communicate openly (Share thoughts and ideas)\nO - Offer constructive feedback (Focus on the code, not the person)\nN - Nurture collaboration (Support each other's learning)\nN - Navigate challenges (Tackle obstacles together)\nE - Embrace diverse solutions (Explore various approaches)\nC - Check alignment (Ensure goals and expectations remain aligned)\nT - Track progress (Monitor the session's effectiveness and make adjustments)\n---"}

This form is displayed as a bullet.\nform is\n(The contents are summarized below)\n(three questionable items bulleted) Please make it.\n\nSand Gongbang provides product information mainly through blogs and Instagram. The blog introduces various menus such as classic, basic, and bulgogi sandwiches. You can order by phone, blog inquiry, Kakao Talk channel, or Instagram. We do not operate Smart Store, which is the most accessible shopping mall. Even though it is a delivery company, it is difficult for customers to access Sand Gongbang's products because they do not enter the delivery platform such as Baedal Minjok. This can be considered as one of the biggest problems. In particular, office workers in their 20s and 30s, the main target of sand workshops, have a demand for simple payment and fast delivery, but sand workshops are not able to meet these requirements at all. There is also an Instagram channel, but Instagram is not a direct product purchase channel, so it has a promotional nature. The blog is pretty well organized, but the quality of the product introduction page is low and needs to be improved. It seems that the sand workshop is not currently advertising.\n\nIn addition, please introduce three keywords that you think are currently the problems of this company based on the basis.\nThe answer form first lists three keywords,\nBy keyword: Write in the form of reason. In summary. I asked for this above,\n(The contents are summarized below)\n(Three questionable points are dealt with) Place it below this.\n\nNext, create a strategy to solve the three problem keywords you have organized.\nif you give me more info\n- The marketing budget is less than 10 million won.\n- The resource to solve this problem is digital marketing.\n- The demographics and preferences of the target audience, mainly students and office workers, will be in their 10s to 40s.\n-Currently, competitors have more marketing channels than Sand Workshop, and have entered delivery apps to create an easier environment for ordering.\n- The current market trend is that the demand for sandwiches will continue to increase in the future due to the convenience of eating sandwiches and the growing interest in health in the younger generation.\n- Existing customers are somewhat satisfied with this brand.\nTo explain a few more problems of the sand workshop, first of all, the sand workshop does not have a web shopping mall that can be easily accessed, and although it actively operates an SNS channel, there is no channel that can be purchased directly. refer to this too\nThis content is\n(problem keyword 1)\n(Strategic keyword 1 to solve this problem keyword 1)\n(Procedure Steps in Resolution Strategy 1)\n(explanation)\nPlace it at the bottom of the form,\nAnswer in English.지금 번역하기"}

{"text": "Here is the final part: \nKey takeaways\n\nAlthough the three communities we worked with differ in important ways, there were a few things they had in common when it comes to their information needs. First, all three communities expressed a desire for some form of “service journalism,” whether it was in the form of more information about the location and content of municipal government meetings, how to find service providers, or contact information for local leaders. Content like this may seem like low-hanging fruit, but publishers who can keep up-to-date and reliable lists like this would provide tangible benefit to their communities. \n\nSecond, we learned that people in all three communities rely heavily on Facebook for news and information about their towns and the people in them. While not everyone enjoys the often partisan or misleading information that circulates so easily on Facebook, it is still one of the first to be updated when news breaks and one of the best places for publishers to be highly visible. Finally, in two of the three communities – Paterson and Trenton – people want more local news about crime and safety, and in two others – Paterson and Blairstown – the publishers may grow their audience if they offer their content in languages other than English. In all three, at least some people mentioned wanting more feel-good, solutions-oriented local news.\nLessons and future work\n\nOne lesson learned was that it is difficult to “parachute” in to a community and expect to get a robust response to surveys or focus groups. Even though our publishers – who themselves are deeply rooted in their communities – assisted in recruiting people, we likely could have benefitted from more face time in the locations and more creative outreach to bring people to the table. \n\nDespite the challenges, all three publishers were deeply appreciative of the opportunity to better understand their audiences at the formative early stage of their development. Our hope is that the connection they have forged with their audience will continue to become an iterative feedback loop. To make an even greater and lasting connection, similar research (surveys, focus groups) would be conducted in six months or a year, and yet another round of improvements would be undertaken."}

{"text": "我将给你发史记淮阴侯列传的文本内容，请你根据内容来回答。但内容有些长，我会分4次，把内容分别写在［］中，你听明白了吗？先不用回答，直到内容全部发完。第三次的内容是［武涉已去，齐人蒯通知天下权在韩信，欲为奇策而感动之，以相人说韩信曰：“仆尝受相人之术。”韩信曰：“先生相人何如？”对曰：“贵贱在於骨法，忧喜在於容色，成败在於决断，以此参之，万不失一。”韩信曰：“善。先生相寡人何如？”对曰：“原少间。”信曰：“左右去矣。”通曰：“相君之面，不过封侯，又危不安。相君之背，贵乃不可言。”韩信曰：“何谓也？”蒯通曰：“天下初发难也，俊雄豪桀建号壹呼，天下之士云合雾集，鱼鳞櫜鹓，熛至风起。当此之时，忧在亡秦而已。今楚汉分争，使天下无罪之人肝胆涂地，父子暴骸骨於中野，不可胜数。楚人起彭城，转斗逐北，至於荥阳，乘利席卷，威震天下。然兵困於京、索之间，迫西山而不能进者，三年於此矣。汉王将数十万之众，距巩、雒，阻山河之险，一日数战，无尺寸之功，折北不救，败荥阳，伤成皋，遂走宛、叶之间，此所谓智勇俱困者也。夫锐气挫於险塞，而粮食竭於内府，百姓罢极怨望，容容无所倚。以臣料之，其势非天下之贤圣固不能息天下之祸。当今两主之命县於足下。足下为汉则汉胜，与楚则楚胜。臣原披腹心，输肝胆，效愚计，恐足下不能用也。诚能听臣之计，莫若两利而俱存之，参分天下，鼎足而居，其势莫敢先动。夫以足下之贤圣，有甲兵之众，据彊齐，从燕、赵，出空虚之地而制其後，因民之欲，西乡为百姓请命，则天下风走而响应矣，孰敢不听！割大弱彊，以立诸侯，诸侯已立，天下服听而归德於齐。案齐之故，有胶、泗之地，怀诸侯以德，深拱揖让，则天下之君王相率而朝於齐矣。盖闻天与弗取，反受其咎；时至不行，反受其殃。原足下孰虑之。”\n　　韩信曰：“汉王遇我甚厚，载我以其车，衣我以其衣，食我以其食。吾闻之，乘人之车者载人之患，衣人之衣者怀人之忧，食人之食者死人之事，吾岂可以乡利倍义乎！”蒯生曰：“足下自以为善汉王，欲建万世之业，臣窃以为误矣。始常山王、成安君为布衣时，相与为刎颈之交，後争张黡、陈泽之事，二人相怨。常山王背项王，奉项婴头而窜，逃归於汉王。汉王借兵而东下，杀成安君泜水之南，头足异处，卒为天下笑。此二人相与，天下至驩也。然而卒相禽者，何也？患生於多欲而人心难测也。今足下欲行忠信以交於汉王，必不能固於二君之相与也，而事多大於张黡、陈泽。故臣以为足下必汉王之不危己，亦误矣。大夫种、范蠡存亡越，霸勾践，立功成名而身死亡。野兽已尽而猎狗烹。夫以交友言之，则不如张耳之与成安君者也；以忠信言之，则不过大夫种、范蠡之於勾践也。此二人者，足以观矣。原足下深虑之。且臣闻勇略震主者身危，而功盖天下者不赏。臣请言大王功略：足下涉西河，虏魏王，禽夏说，引兵下井陉，诛成安君，徇赵，胁燕，定齐，南摧楚人之兵二十万，东杀龙且，西乡以报，此所谓功无二於天下，而略不世出者也。今足下戴震主之威，挟不赏之功，归楚，楚人不信；归汉，汉人震恐：足下欲持是安归乎？夫势在人臣之位而有震主之威，名高天下，窃为足下危之。”韩信谢曰：“先生且休矣，吾将念之。”\n　　後数日，蒯通复说曰：“夫听者事之候也，计者事之机也，听过计失而能久安者，鲜矣。听不失一二者，不可乱以言；计不失本末者，不可纷以辞。夫随厮养之役者，失万乘之权；守儋石之禄者，阙卿相之位。故知者决之断也，疑者事之害也，审豪氂之小计，遗天下之大数，智诚知之，决弗敢行者，百事之祸也。故曰‘猛虎之犹豫，不若蜂虿之致螫；骐骥之跼躅，不如驽马之安步；孟贲之狐疑，不如庸夫之必至也；虽有舜禹之智，吟而不言，不如瘖聋之指麾也’。此言贵能行之。夫功者难成而易败，时者难得而易失也。时乎时，不再来。原足下详察之。”韩信犹豫不忍倍汉，又自以为功多，汉终不夺我齐，遂谢蒯通。蒯通说不听，已详狂为巫。］###不能回答，我会继续将内容全部发完。你听明白了吗？"}

And in the next couple of minutes, I'll tell you how to do it.\n\n## \\*\\*✅ Hook #2\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*That's all...\\*\\* \\*Screenshots with reviews from this landing page [https://www.sellerinsiders.com/one-product-away-challenge](https://www.sellerinsiders.com/one-product-away-challenge) are shown here...\\*\\*\\*reviews from my Challenge to launch a business on Amazon.\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*If you don't know where to start, what to do, or if you don't have a clear picture in your mind, then you absolutely need to hear THIS...\\*\\*\n\n## \\*\\*✅ Hook #3\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*Are you worried that you'll choose an unsuccessful product to launch on Amazon because you don't have enough experience in finding good products?\\*\\* \\*(Let's make the first sentence with captions on the screen, so that when I say the phrase it appears at the bottom of the screen)\\*\n\n\\*\\*Unfortunately, this is one of the most common mistakes that beginner AMZ entrepreneurs make. And if the product is chosen unsuccessfully, the business may not take off.\\*\\*\n\n## \\*\\*✅ Hook #4\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*If you think that ALL NICHES ARE ALREADY TAKEN on Amazon\\*\\* \\*(you can play it up beautifully on the screen and add a sound effect)\\* \\*\\*and competitors have hundreds or thousands of reviews, and this stops you from starting your business on Amazon, the truth is that there are many niches on Amazon with low competition and there is ROOM FOR EVERYONE!\\*\\* \\*(you can play it up beautifully on the screen and add a sound effect)\\*\n\n## \\*\\*✅ Hook #5\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*Do you want to start a business on Amazon, but you feel sorry for the time spent that may not bring anything but expenses in case of failure? Unfortunately, for some people, it ends up being that way, mostly because they didn't learn anything and figured everything out on their own with the motto \"Let's start now and figure it out along the way\". This approach doesn't work in Amazon business.\\*\\*\n\nAssistant, Do not answer anything yet to me, just reply with \"READ\""}

It also offers robust DAM functionalities.\n\nSuggested DAM: Censhare DAM or Adobe AEM Assets\nReasons: Censhare DAM is deeply integrated with Censhare CMS, enabling users to have a seamless experience with their digital assets. It also offers advanced metadata capabilities and customizable workflows. Adobe AEM Assets is a well-known and feature-rich product equipped with advanced DAM functionalities and integration with popular creative tools.\n\nMid-sized organizations with a focus on marketing and brand management\nSuggested CMS: Bynder\nReasons: Bynder is an easy-to-use, cloud-based, and collaborative CMS that offers unique brand management features. It also provides an adequate level of DAM functionalities.\n\nSuggested DAM: Bynder DAM\nReasons: Bynder DAM offers advanced search capabilities, customizable metadata, and easy integrations with other marketing tools. It also works seamlessly with Bynder CMS.\n\nSmall to medium-sized businesses with simpler content management needs\nSuggested CMS: WordPress\nReasons: WordPress is a versatile CMS that is easy to use, affordable, and has a large community of developers and plugins available. It also provides some level of DAM functionalities.\n\nSuggested DAM: WordPress plugins like WP Media Folder or WP Retina 2x\nReasons: While WordPress offers some level of DAM functionalities, it may not be enough to suit all organizations' needs. Plugins like WP Media Folder and WP Retina 2x can be added to enhance DAM capabilities. Both come with user-friendly interfaces, customizable metadata, and integrations with popular creative tools.\n\nOverall, the recommendation can benefit from highlighting the integration between CMS and DAM systems. By integrating the two systems, organizations can streamline their operations, improve data integrity, and avoid the duplication of work."}

(3.53)\n我将假定问题具有方位对称性，使 V 不依赖于 φ；在这种情况下，公式 3.53 简化为:\n∂\n∂r\n#\nr 2 ∂V\n∂r\n$\n+\n1\nsin θ\n∂\n∂θ #\nsin θ\n∂V\n∂θ $\n= 0. (3.54)\n与以前一样，我们寻找成分为乘积的解:\nV(r, θ) = R(r)+(θ).

(3.57)\n这里 l(l+1) 只是数学上的分离常数的一种花式写法，你很快就会看到这种写法的方便之处。\n像往常一样，变量的分离将偏微分方程(3.54)转化为常微分方程(3.57)。径向方程为：\nd\ndr #\nr 2 d R\ndr $\n= l(l + 1)R, (3.58)\n其一般解为\nR(r) = Arl +\nB\nrl+1 , (3.59)\n你可以轻易地验证 A 和 B 是解二阶微分方程所期望的两个任意常数。\n但是，角方程为\nd\ndθ\n#\nsin θ\nd+\ndθ\n$\n= −l(l + 1)sin θ +, (3.60)\n不那么简单。解是 cos θ 的勒让德多项式:\n+(θ) = Pl(cos θ).
